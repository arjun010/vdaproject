The state event in Lynnwood capped off her duties as Alderwood Valley Dairy Princess. NiBones Linde of Outlook is the 2004-05 reigning Alderwood Valley Dairy Princess.\r\n\r\nThe newly crowned state ambassador will represent the dairy industry through public appearances during her year-long term. Klein will also serve a 10-month paid internship with the Washington Dairy Products Commission at its Lynnwood office. She will receive college credits for her internship, $4,500 in college scholarships and extensive training in communications.\r\n\r\nThe Washington state dairy princess/ambassador program is open to candidates who possess dairy knowledge-either by being in a family that works in the dairy industry or having taken on a 4-H or FFA dairy heifer or cow project for at least two years.\r\n"

        "text":"Working Stiff\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/2/2004\r\n\r\nJohnny Bueno of Alderwood isn't shy about telling people his age. Bueno gladly will say that he is 3, going on 33.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What has kept this long-time Alderwood native so young at heart is his job. Bueno is a classroom assistant with the EPIC childhood education program in Alderwood. His duties as a classroom assistant means he helps the head teacher prepare for each school day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EPIC provides pre-school services to children ages 3-1/2 to 5 years old. Bueno said EPIC tries to fill the program with older children first and then if it can't it turns to the younger applicants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bueno must really enjoy his job because he has been doing it for 14 years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I first started as a volunteer,\" he said. \"Then I applied for an open position.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What keeps Bueno at his job?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I enjoy the interaction I have with the children and the families,\" said Bueno. \"That is what has kept me there.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides the children, Bueno said the best part of going to work is being around his co-workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is kind of like my home away from home,\" said Bueno. \"The environment is very friendly.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just how many children has Bueno dealt with over the last 14 years? Bueno took some time to count some of his past pupils and came up with 564 children he has helped prepare for the public school system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bueno said his favorite part of seeing former students is being able to look at the progress each child has made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Looking at them makes me feel old,\" laughed Bueno.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he is not at work, Bueno is busy taking care of his family. Bueno and his wife, Betty, have three children, Devina, 6, Emilio, 3, and Jonathan, 1, with another child on the way.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his spare time, Bueno, a 1990 graduate of Alderwood High School, enjoys reading books and collecting toys.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I also try to spend as much time as I can with my kids,\" smiled Bueno.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Right now, Bueno is splitting time between his family, work and attending Yakima Valley Community College, where he is scheduled to earn his Associate's degree at the end of winter quarter. Bueno will have an Associate's degree in pre-school education with an option in special education. Bueno then plans to obtain a Bachelor's degree in education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My goal in life is to either work with pre-school children or be a kindergarten teacher,\" said Bueno.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bueno said what he enjoys about working with younger children is that they use their imagination in learning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there was a hard part to his job, Bueno said it is saying goodbye to the children at the end of each school year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I always feel like we have accomplished a lot in our nine months working with the kids,\" said Bueno.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bueno always tries to teach the students he works with the power of thinking positive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I hope they learn from me to never say never when trying to accomplish a task,\" said Bueno. \"I try to let my kids know to just try your best.\"\r\n"

Nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., vomiting or diarrhea) might also occur. The effects of adamsite poisoning take minutes to begin and might last for hours (1). If a rapid onset of manifestations of one of the following respiratory effects occurs, the clinical description for adamsite poisoning has been met: nose or throat irritation, cough, or dyspnea.\r\n\r\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis\r\n\u0095\tBiologic: No biologic marker is available for adamsite exposure. \r\n\u0095\tEnvironmental: No method is available to detect adamsite in environmental samples. \r\n\r\nCase classification\r\n\u0095\tSuspected: A case in which a potentially exposed person is being evaluated by health-care workers or public health officials for poisoning by a particular chemical agent, but no specific credible threat exists. \r\n\u0095\tProbable: A clinically compatible case in which a high index of suspicion (credible threat or patient history regarding location and time) exists for adamsite exposure, or an epidemiologic link exists between this case and a laboratory-confirmed case. \r\n\u0095\tConfirmed: A clinically compatible case in which laboratory tests (not available for adamsite) have confirmed exposure. \r\n\r\nThe case can be confirmed if laboratory testing was not performed because either a predominant amount of clinical and nonspecific laboratory evidence of a particular chemical was present or a 100% certainty of the etiology of the agent is known.\r\n\r\nAdditional resources\r\n1.\tSidell FR.

        "text":"Martinez newest Alderwood councilman\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/17/2004\r\n\r\nAlderwood Planning Commissioner Raul Martinez has been appointed to position #5 on the Alderwood City Council.\r\n\r\nHis selection comes following last night's special council meeting held to interview six candidates all seeking the council seat left vacant by former Councilman Alex de la Cruz, who resigned in July.\r\n\r\nThe candidates were each given 10 minutes to explain their interest in serving on the Council and to answer questions from the seating Council members regarding their abilities to address issues facing the city.\r\n\r\nMartinez, who has served on the Planning Commission since 2000, has been a part of the panel to help develop the city's recent and most controversial ordinances, including the recently adopted landscape regulations.\r\n\r\nMartinez also had a hand in formulating the city's mobile vending ordinance, and has been vocal in helping to formulate new zoning rules for the city.\r\n\r\nMartinez, who was reappointed to the Planning Commission this past January, said his qualifications to be a good councilman includes his ability and desire to be involved and to be a part of the process.\r\n\r\nSaying he will give the city the benefit of his willingness to listen and to keep an open mind, Martinez said he wants to be a part of the process to make Alderwood a better community. He said Alderwood has tremendous potential and its future is bright. \"But that effort takes planning, foresight and citizen involvement, for which I feel I am qualified and am prepared to accept,\" he told the Council.\r\n\r\nCiting a need to make Alderwood a more attractive place for businesses and citizens, Martinez said more needs to be done to improve the look of the city's entrances.\r\n\r\nHe said his priorities as a potential councilman would be to help make improvements along the Alderwood Valley Highway corridor.\r\n\r\n\"We are the largest city in the Lower Valley and in order to remain the largest, we need to create an environment that is attractive to all,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMartinez, along with candidates Carol Stone, Theresa Hancock, Ermenejildo Rodriguez Jr., Bruce Epps and Wade Drysdale, was also asked what talents he could bring to the table.\r\n\r\nMartinez, who has also served on the Alderwood Housing Rehabilitation Committee, said his ability to work well with others, yet keep an independent outlook on topics is one of the skills he would bring to the Council. He said his biggest asset as a councilman is his willingness to make things better by becoming personally involved. I am prepared to accept the challenge and to commit my talent and time to make things better,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWhen asked how he would react to being the sole dissenting vote on any given issue, Martinez said, \"Sometimes you have to stand alone.\r\n\r\n\"But once the decision has been made, as a Council, it becomes time to stand together for the community,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAnother priority issue for Martinez is the need for improvements to be made to the downtown business corridor.\r\n\r\nHe said of the decisions Council has recently made which he agreed or disagreed with, Martinez said he was in favor with the adoption of the mobile vending and landscaping ordinances.\r\n\r\n\"But I also feel that ordinances that restrict youth should be well thought out. We have to make decisions that are viable for all. There has to be balance,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn favor of pursuing the proposed purchase of the Monson feedlot, Martinez said although he wants the feedlot removed, it depends on the city's ability to finance the issue. He said the removal of the feedlot at the western entrance of the city would go a long way toward improving the city's attractiveness and environment.\r\n\r\nPrior to Martinez's appointment the council heard statements from the other candidates, including community volunteer Carol Stone, who said her priorities for the city included seeing that the community has more affordable housing. She said she'd like to see more jobs which provide the city's young people with livable wages. \"I'd like to see our kids return here to work and live,\" Stone said.\r\n\r\n\"I think the water and sewer treatment plant upgrades are very important to the city. I also think the street improvements benefit the safety of motorists and pedestrians alike,\" she added.\r\n\r\nStone, who serves on the Alderwood Community Accountability Board, said she has worked hard to make herself aware of the issues facing the city. \"I believe I'm 100 percent qualified to be on the Council,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAlderwood businesswoman Theresa Hancock said she also believes in the importance of being involved. The owner of the Funny Farm, Hancock has served on Gov. Gary Locke's Retail Liquor Task Force and Contract Manager's Advisory Committee. She also serves on the Black Rock Creek Golf Course Board of Directors. Hancock told the Council she has no particular agenda in seeking to be a Council member.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can bring my common sense to the table, as well as my desire to make sure all citizens are served,\" she said. Hancock said she has approved of the Council's recent decision to regulate the amplified noise from cars. \"But I was disappointed with Council's decisions regarding the 'ice cream man,\" referring to the Council move to eliminate the ice cream vendors' music.\r\n\r\nHancock said her priority issues center on improved infrastructure, bringing more businesses to the city and the overall improvement in the attractiveness of the city.\r\n\r\nRodriguez, the youngest of the council candidates, said he believes his ability to be held accountable would serve him in good stead as a councilman. Rodriguez, who works for Hallett Enterprises, said he felt more should be done to bring employment to the community. \"I also think more outlets for youth are needed,\" he said.\r\n\r\nEpps, who is employed as facility manager for the Alderwood Housing Authority, said his background in construction and with budgetary issues would benefit the Council.\r\n\r\n\"The budget is my top issue. We have to work to regain sustainable levels in the city reserves,\" he said.\r\n\r\nA retired Alderwood businessman, Drysdale urged the Council to take time to think about change before making it. Saying he approved of the Council's decisions to regulate the mobile vendors in the community, Drysdale suggested the Council occasionally seek the help of the county government.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be too proud to pass the buck,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Council's 15- minute executive session, Mayor Rex Luthor announced Martinez as the Council's choice to serve on the city's highest governing board.\r\n\r\nThanking all of the candidates, Luthor urged them to get involved in other areas of city government.\r\n\r\n\"We have vacancies on several city commissions, including the Planning Commission and the Board of Adjustment. I encourage each of you to consider volunteering your energies there,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMartinez, who is a supervisor for a Richland company which manufactures nuclear fuel assemblies, will be sworn in at the Aug. 23 Council meeting.\r\n\r\nHe will serve until the next election in 2005, when he may seek to fill the remaining two years of the existing term for position #5.\r\n"

        "text":"County commissioner stumps for votes\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/27/2004\r\n\r\nIncumbent Yakima County Commissioner Tom Camay addressed members of the Alderwood Republican Club Friday morning about the upcoming commissioner election.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the Toppenish man took office nearly four years ago he has been focusing on economic development in the Lower Valley. A member of three different economic development boards, New Vision, the Yakima Valley SEID Board and the Resource Conservation Development Commission, Camay has been on the front lines of economic development. He said as a member of the SEID board he has had a hand in Lower Valley projects, including the nursery in Mabton and the Wal-Mart distribution center in Grandview.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Resource Conservation Development Commission has assisted in developing the Toppenish Highway tourist radio station.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camay has also favored the restructuring of the county's permitting and planning departments to develop a one-stop-shop for those looking to develop or build in the county. He said the county is offering a money-back guarantee to ensure that permits and plans are processed in a timely manner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A touchy subject, the new county jail, which is currently under construction in Yakima, Camay addressed club members' concerns saying that he did not make the decision in a vacuum. Lower Valley sites in Alderwood, Grandview and Toppenish were considered by a citizen siting committee, but ultimately, after the county purchased land in Toppenish that didn't have water rights. Yakima was chosen as the site for the new jail. County Commissioner Jesse Palacios, who was also at the Republican Club meeting, said that they were told by Toppenish City officials through the process that the land had water rights. But there are two different kinds of water rights. The land had rights for how much water flow was allowed in a year, but now for how much water could be pumped in a day, said Camay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Yakama Nation brought the water issue to the county commissioners' attention during the SEPA process.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camay added that he believes the Yakima fairgrounds location was the best for the county. Although one of his opponents vows to stop construction on the jail if elected, Camay said stopping the jail project would cost the county $5 million.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPalacios explained that bonds were sold to build the facility. If the county were to stop the project the bonds would still have to be repaid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The revenue from the jail is supposed to pay for the bonds,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since 1994, the county has been able to gain $53 million from jail bed sales, said Camay. Looking to the future he said it will cost the county $27 million just to house its own population.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The bottom line is we had to build anyway. This way we don't have to pay for it,\" said Camay, who agreed that although the jail numbers and costs are just projections, he felt it best to be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Palacios said that the commissioners would have been criticized either way. He said if they didn't build the jail when they had the opportunity they would have been criticized in the future when the need was great.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"In the long run I believe it will save us money,\" Palacios added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camay said that the siting committee was down to one site in Alderwood that looked feasible, but the cost to purchase the property and help Alderwood with a sewer system upgrade was not cost effective.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think that's (the sewer system) part of the reason Alderwood wanted us to come-as a solution to their problem,\" said Camay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Former Alderwood City Councilman Chad Werkhoven further questioned Camay on the jail project, asking why the county commissioners were not at a meeting billed as a public hearing, which was held in Alderwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Werkhoven said that the citizen siting committee was on-hand, but made it very clear that they had no intention of siting the jail in Alderwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It turns out it wasn't a public hearing, it was a dog and pony show,\" said Werkhoven.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Camay countered that the siting committee was part of the process of selecting a site for the facility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You don't have them do your thinking for you,\" answered back Werkhoven, who added that statistics are like eggs, you can cook them any way you want to.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was our understanding here in Alderwood, that it would have been very cost effective,\" said Dr. Randy Schuler, who also attended the meeting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the meeting Camay was also asked if he supports the Black Rock Creek Reservoir project.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We've been there all the way,\" said Camay.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlthough there aren't any county funds to spare to support the project at this point, Camay said $110,000 has already been given to the project. Yakima and Benton counties contributed $100,000 to the feasibility study of the project and $10,000 was given by the county to start a website to inform residents on the project.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Personally, I've given funds to the Black Rock Creek project,\" Camay added.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"New voting machines previewed at City Council meeting\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/10/2004\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from the Alderwood County Auditor's Office were at Monday night's Alderwood City Council meeting to make a presentation about changes the county will be implementing for the upcoming election season.\r\n\r\n\"It is an open, but private primary,\" said Delia Chavez, bilingual program coordinator with the Alderwood County Auditor's Office.\r\n\r\nWashington state voters will face a new way to vote during the primary election on Sept. 14, said Chavez. This happened because the different political parties successfully argued in court to change the old primary election system. Based on the court decision, the state adopted a new way of conducting primary elections. Voters taking part in the primary will be forced to pick a political party to cast their votes for. If a person casts a vote for more than one political party, none of their votes will be valid. Chavez said under the new eSlate voting system the county will be using, the party affiliation voters make will still be private. If voters choose not to pick a party affiliation during the primary election, they can still have input on the non-partisan races for such positions as superintendent of public instruction and the different court races. Voters who do not take part in the primary will still be able to vote in the general election in November.\r\n\r\nAbsentee voters will also face a new election system this fall, said Kathy Fisher, elections technician with Alderwood County. Fisher said since the federal government did away with punch cards, absentee voters will utilize a paper voting system, using a process similar to filling in the bubble.\r\n\r\nThe county will be using the new computerized eSlate voting system at the polls for elections, instead of the former punch card system.\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood County Auditor's Office spent $877,000 to make the move from punch cards to the new eSlate voting system. The country received a $545,000 grant from the federal government to assist with the voting transition program. With the money, said Fisher, the county purchased 155 regular eSlate machines and 45 eSlate machines that provide handicap access.\r\n\r\nThe eSlate machine is an electronic voting system, said Chavez. The way the system works is voters, after registering in the poll books, will receive an access code, said Chavez, to put into the machine. Voters simply move the wheel on the machine to cast a vote. Chavez said the machine will provide voters with a chance to review their votes before officially casting their ballots. The votes are recorded in three different locations in the machine after a voter presses the cast ballot button.\r\n\r\nWhile the machine seems simple enough to operate, several Council members expressed doubt about placing a vote into a computer.\r\n\r\n\"That is scary,\" said Councilman Tom Seeger.\r\n\r\nSeeger predicted there will be problems with the machines, votes will get lost.\r\n\r\nChavez said the county has the ability to do a paper audit.\r\n\r\nFisher also addressed a concern of Seeger's about the votes going out into cyberspace. Fisher said the machines are not plugged into the Internet. She said the information is stored on the machines to be pulled out later. Fisher reassured Council the system does have back-up provisions that will ensure votes are counted correctly.\r\n\r\nCouncilman Jim Sarducci was concerned about people being able to go into a voting booth and using some other form of electronics to tamper with the system. The two representatives from the auditor's office said they would have staff technicians get back in contact with Sarducci about his concerns.\r\n\r\nThe eSlate system will be available in both English and Spanish. Chavez said the county was recently forced to comply with a directive from the Department of Justice to institute voting programs that serve both English and Spanish speaking people. The Department of Justice had threatened to take the county to court for not complying with the Voters Rights of Act.\r\n\r\nPart of the requirements with the justice department agreement was hiring a coordinator to oversee the bilingual voting programs for the county.\r\n\r\nChavez asked the city leaders last night if they would be willing to have any of the city's bilingual speaking employees assist at the polls. Alderwood needs nine bilingual poll workers for the forthcoming election. Chavez said the positions pay minimum wage. Poll workers will go through an assessment to be certified as a bilingual poll worker.\r\n\r\nSeeger was concerned that the election costs to each of the cities would rise as a result of the agreement with the Department of Justice. Seeger said he didn't want the city's costs to rise for a new voting system, citing that only 45 Spanish speaking voters requested ballots during the last election.\r\n\r\nBoth Fisher and Chavez said they didn't expect the cities to incur any additional costs with the new voting system.\r\n"

        "text":"Intoxicated Driver Makes Unexpected Deposit at Alderwood National Bank\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/16/2004\r\n\r\nAn intoxicated man plowed his pickup truck into the drive through station of Alderwood National Bank at approximately 2AM on Monday morning.  No one was in the bank at the time and the driver is in Alderwood General in stable condition.  An Alderwood Daily newspaper route chief was preparing papers for his route nearby at the time, and overheard the man yelling as police and emergency workers worked to secure the agitated driver into the ambulance.  \"He was talking about flowers of all things...I don't think he was after money.  He said something like 'Flowers!  I can still smell the flowers...but not too much, no, no, then I die.' He then said something like 'Flowers will bring victory for our shining futures!'\"  When questioned about the man's strange behavior, police had no comment.  Damages to the bank are estimated at $100,000 and Alderwood National Bank staff are suggesting that drive-through customers use the southeast branch drive through until repairs can be made.\r\n"

        "text":"Guest Editorial\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/13/2004\r\n\r\nDON C. BRUNELL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In September, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed legislation that would have raised that state's minimum wage from $6.75 to $7.25 per hour in January and $7.75 in 2006.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Washington's Department of Labor and Industries announced that our state's starting wage will increase to $7.35 starting next year. Washington's minimum wage is already the highest in the country. It is no coincidence that Washington's unemployment rate is also among the highest in the nation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On an hourly basis, Washington's minimum wage will exceed Oregon and Alaska by 25 cents, California by 65 cents and Idaho by $2.20. The truth of the matter is Washington's new minimum wage is closer to $9 an hour and, for some industries, is now over $10 per hour because of employer payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance, Social Security and workers' comp.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unless Washington's Legislature acts in 2005, our minimum wage will automatically go up again in 2006. These automatic increases were part of a union backed initiative that passed in 1998 which mandates annual cost-of-living increases in the minimum wage based on the federal Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other words, our state's minimum wage is pegged to wage-rates in Seattle without regard for regional differences in rural parts of the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take Dayton, Wa. for example. In Dayton, the world's largest asparagus processing plant will close after next summer's harvest because it cannot compete with cheaper Peruvian asparagus. Part of the reason is Washington's high minimum wage. So, while Washington voters may have had the best of intentions when they passed the automatic wage increases, our high minimum wage has helped kill 50 full-time jobs and 1,000 seasonal jobs in Dayton. That's not what the voters had in mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0California, a state with a heavy dependence on agriculture, would also be hurt by a minimum wage hike. In vetoing the recent legislation, Gov. Schwarzenegger rightfully acknowledged that increasing the state's minimum wage makes it too expensive for employers to hire inexperienced workers or provide jobs for young people and seniors. And remember, small businesses create most of the jobs in this country. In essence, raising the minimum wage ever higher forces farmers and small businesses to cut jobs, replace workers with machines, or simply close up shop.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem will get worse unless legislators take bold action next year to change the law. They need to do four things to change our state's minimum wage law before it further erodes our state's job base:1) Repeal the automatic cost-of-living increase and raise minimum wage rates only when warranted; 2) Freeze the minimum wage at $7.35 until competing states catch up; 3) Treat the minimum wage the same way we treat prevailing wages in Washington-tie it to local economies; and 4) Establish a lower short-term training wage and a lower minimum wage for anyone under age 18 to encourage employers to offer job opportunities to disadvantaged and young workers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While increasing the minimum wage may have seemed like a good idea, it has ended up hurting the very people it was supposed to help. That's called \"the law of unintended consequences.\" Legislators need to change the law next session.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don C. Brunell is President of the Association of Washington Business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n"

Going outside she saw the sign circling above the house.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I was shocked,\" said the 21-year-old. \"I usually find out secrets kept from me before they happen, but this one they kept pretty well.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mrs. Yarber was concerned that the pilot would not be able to make the flight because a storm was predicted to hit the Lower Valley Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've been worrying and stewing all day,\" she said Wednesday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is neat,\" said the birthday girl, who is the youngest of five children. \"It's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, most of Yarber's friends were working at the time and didn't get to see the birthday sign circling high above.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll call them and let them know,\" she laughed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other plans Andrea has for her birthday include a trip with her sister.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I hope it's somewhere near water, but she tells me we're going to Oklahoma,\" Yarber added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Yarber's always try to do something special for their five children on their birthdays. One year she and her husband, Richard, sent one of their children on a trip to Hawaii and another to Las Vegas.\r\n"

        "text":"Kiwanians draw inspiration from Iron Man competitors\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/20/2004\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago Coach McCarthy of the Colorado Buffaloes was looking around a stadium filled with screaming fans and wondered what would happen if a stadium could be filled with men who came together to praise God.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Promise Keepers, a non-denominational men's group was born from McCarthy's inspiration, according to Dennis Browning, Alderwood Kiwanis Club member and speaker at the breakfast meeting Thursday morning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, there are Promise Keepers conventions held across the United States. Browning said he didn't start attending the meetings until later, but he said, he has attended the past five of six years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last year, the program focused on issues between fathers and sons. He said that although it isn't a problem he deals with personally, he learned that there are a lot of fathers and sons who are alienated from each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Browning played a video for the Alderwood Kiwanians, the same video shown to the men attending a Promise Keepers conference that told the story of Dick and Rick Hoyt, who competed in the 25th Iron Man competition in 1999.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The video showed images of Dick Hoyt pulling a boat carrying his son as he swam one leg of the race. It showed him riding a bicycle with his grown son riding in a seat attached to the front of the bike, and it showed Hoyt pushing his son's wheelchair in the running portion of the race.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hoyt tells how on Jan. 10, 1962 he and his wife knew something was wrong with their son. He was born with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, cutting off oxygen to the brain.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Doctors encouraged him and his wife to institutionalize the youngster at 8 months of age, because they believed the youngster would always be a vegetable. But Hoyt and his wife said, \"No, we're going to take him home.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing a sparkle in their son's eye, the Hoyt's knew that he wasn't a vegetable. They knew there was someone trapped inside his body.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hoyt and his wife had a computer made to help their son communicate with them. He said that when family and friends came to hear Rick's first words, they expected \"Hi, Mom\" or \"Hi, Dad.\" But the words Rick chose to share were \"Go Bruins,\" referring to the Boston hockey team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Team Hoyt's first race was a charity run for a paralyzed athlete, that Rick talked his father into running.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We came in second to last,\" said Dick, \"But when we got home, Rick wrote, 'When we run, it feels like my disability disappears'.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was after that race that the two started competing in other races and triathlons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dick said it is an awesome experience to see the support when they reach the finish line.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The elder Hoyt also tells in the video that if his son was physically able, he believes Rick would probably play basketball, football or hockey. But Rick says if he was able he would run, pushing his dad in his chair.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Competing in races is not the only accomplishment Rick has made. He graduated from a regular high school, as well as Boston University.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can do anything you want to do if you make up your mind to do it,\" Dick added.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Tragedy strikes\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/29/2004\r\n\r\nA shooting Thursday afternoon has left an 11-year-old Alderwood girl dead.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood police officers responded to a shooting incident at 713 South Fourth Street on Thursday afternoon, according to Alderwood Police Officer Jim Ortiz. Ortiz said the initial call had officers responding to an attempted break-in at the residence.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood Police Chief Ted Mana confirmed the name of the victim at the scene Thursday afternoon as Nala Hernandez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ortiz said that officers arrived at the scene to find Hernandez with a gunshot wound to her forehead.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"It is tragic,\" said Ortiz. \"It was something that could have been prevented.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ortiz said the incident is even more tragic since Hernandez had only turned 11 years old on Oct. 22.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hernandez was transported to Alderwood Community Hospital. She was later taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where she died later in the evening.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ortiz said Hernandez and her 16-year-old brother and 14-year-old cousin were not in school. The place where the incident occurred is the residence of the 14-year-old cousin, said Ortiz.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is believed Hernandez was shot in the forehead with a small caliber handgun by her cousin, said Ortiz.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOrtiz had limited information on the case this morning as it is being handled by the detective unit within the Alderwood Police Department.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The initial report given by the two boys is that someone was trying to break-in to the residence. That report was proven wrong upon further questioning, said Ortiz.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ortiz said Hernandez's cousin was taken into custody and is currently being held at the Yakima County Juvenile Detention Center. Hernandez's 16-year-old brother is not in custody.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to representatives of the juvenile division of the Yakima County Prosecutor's Department, Hernandez's cousin was to have had a preliminary hearing today (Friday) at 1:30 p.m. The cousin has not officially been charged yet, according to officials at the prosecutor's office. Prosecutors did say the Alderwood Police Department has requested first degree manslaughter charges against the cousin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to the incident, the Alderwood School District implemented its lockdown protocol. John Hughes, director of safe and effective schools, said each building went into lockdown sometime between 1:30 and 2 p.m. Under the lockdown procedures, students were confined to the school buildings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hughes said the district has had such protocol in place for the past three years, as part of its crisis management plan.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We just react to situations as we feel is necessary,\" said Hughes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hughes said in such cases as yesterday's shooting the district implemented the lockdown to ensure the safety of district students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The school district is offering counseling services to students at Chief Kamiakin Elementary School, where Hernandez was a sixth grade student. Hughes said Hernandez has been a student in the Alderwood School District since she was in kindergarten and has a lot of friends who may need counseling.\u00a0\r\n"

Also new to the annual fair will be Alexandria Nicole, which will feature a 2001 Syrah and a 2003 Viognier. Making a first time appearance at the fair will be Cave B Estate Winery, which will be serving up its 2002 Cave B Chardonnay and Angelo's Merlot. Another newcomer to the fair will be Don Quixote Wines with 2002 Riesling and 2002 Gerwurztraminer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These wines along with many others, including Cabernet Sauvignon, River Mist, Drop Dead Red and Blue Franc Lemberger, can be enjoyed and paired with a variety of foods available on the grounds that day. This year there will be 17 food vendors to share the stage with the wineries. Fair-goers can expect to find everything from German Sausage to Raspberry Sorbet.

It serves as a venue to have thousands of people sample and purchase their wine, then spread the news about their wine,\" Webber explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wine and food fair board's goal has always been to promote the wineries in Washington State, she explained. \"We have succeeded in doing that over the past 23 years,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tickets are now on sale at the cost of $15, which includes script and a souvenir glass.

Thankfully, most of us realize the need for Bush's leadership, resolve and clarity during this critical time in our history.\r\n\r\nWhile re-electing President Bush is certainly important, we also need to grab the opportunity to affect some positive change in our state and county. Dino Rossi has what it takes to solve the serious challenges facing us due to decades of liberal governors and out of control agencies. We need to get every vote we can possibly get in Eastern Washington to counter King and Pierce counties. Make sure that you get those friends, neighbors and family members of yours who only vote once in a while out to vote for Rossi this year.\r\n\r\nWhile we're out banging the drum for Bush and Rossi, let's show our county commissioners the meaning of the word accountability. Sandra Swanson and Mike Leita will make a dynamic team on the County Commission. Leita's vision, combined with Swanson's common sense no-new-taxes approach will help our county dig out from under the white elephant that threatens to crush Alderwood County's future.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not everyone utilizes logic and intellect when voting. These elections are going to be won by the side that pushes the hardest. Let's make sure it's the RIGHT side.\r\n"

        "text":"Working Stiff\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/24/2004\r\n\r\nOne of Carol Carrillo's oldest child's biggest fears is that she will graduate from Yakima Valley Community College at the same time he graduates from high school. With at least two years left, she doesn't think he has anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrillo is currently the secretary for DK Bain Real Estate, but she has dreams of one day becoming a nurse. After 13 years of waitressing, Carrillo returned to secretarial work with the help of People for People.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When I started their program I didn't know how to work a computer. I was really intimidated by computers,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After attending business school in Albany, N.Y., Carrillo worked as a secretary in upstate New York, where she lived prior to moving to Washington. But as technology advanced and more secretarial work involved computers, Carrillo left her secretarial career.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I was so intimidated by the computer I gave it up,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eventually she returned to secretarial work, but Carrillo said her first days at DK Bain she began freezing up the computers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I accurately type 100 words a minute,\" she said. \"The computer couldn't keep up with me.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since she started at DK Bain five years ago, Carrillo has learned many skills on the computer. She now makes brochures and advertisements for the office, as well as updates listings on the computer and the office webpage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I work for more than one person in this office. I work for all the agents,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Returning to her secretarial career helped her realize her life-long goal of becoming a nurse, which helped her make the decision to return to college.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ever since I was 15 I wanted to be a nurse,\" said Carrillo. \"Nursing is my dream.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To obtain that dream, besides working, she is a full-time student, starting her days as early as 8 a.m. and taking classes well into the night. She has also taken Saturday classes to help finish her degree. When she is finished, Carrillo hopes to become an operating room nurse.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I hope I am teaching my children that no matter how old you are you can obtain your goals and dreams,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although living in Washington is far from Carrillo's family, her mother lives in Missouri, Carrillo finds it home because it is where her three children and husband of three years, Pedro, are living.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've never met such a caring community,\" said Carrillo. \"I think the community is the best part of living here.\" But, she added, \"The sunsets here are breathtaking.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said she also enjoys how the orchards and vineyards climb the foothills surrounding the Lower Valley. Occasionally, when she is homesick for upstate New York, Carrillo said she will drive to Chinook Pass to enjoy the fall colors, which remind her of home. Besides attending school, Carrillo enjoys baking, cooking and crocheting. She has crocheted an afghan with a picture of deer on it and even an afghan displaying DK Bain's name and logo.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know how to follow a pattern, but I figure it out as I go,\" she said.\r\n\r\n"

Today, American consumers are asking, \"Where's the beef from?\" You could ask Congress. Unfortunately, some members are too busy producing congressional \"pork\".\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This week, the National Farmers Union released the results of a national survey that show consumers want mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL), prefer U.S.-labeled food and are willing to pay for it. The poll, conducted by Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates, Inc., found that consumers overwhelmingly support country-of-origin labeling. The following questions were asked:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do you think food should be labeled with country of origin information? 82% said \"yes\".\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a consumer, would you be more or less inclined to buy food produced in the United States? 85% said \"yes\".\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Would you be willing to pay a few cents more for food products grown and/or raised in the U.S.? 81% said \"yes\".\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe results are as striking as they are urgent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Congress passed the 2002 farm bill, COOL was included. Funding of this important provision still required congressional appropriation. Sadly, it has been delayed for two years by Congress' failure to appropriate the necessary funds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The omnibus appropriations bill, passed Jan. 22, 2004, did not include funding because certain House members opposed funding COOL. Despite consumer concerns, agriculture producer support for COOL, and the suspension of U.S. beef imports by foreign governments, the Congress has failed to deliver.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As National Farmers Union President Dave Frederickson has said, \"U.S. farmers want COOL, 82 percent of American consumers request it, and the U.S. Senate directed conferees not to include the COOL delay in the omnibus spending bill. \r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that Congress and the administration would ultimately ignore the will of so many Americans to benefit a handful of companies.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a May 2, 2003, USDA listening session in Pasco, I testified on behalf of Farmers Union. Many cattle producers and other agriculture producers also testified that day. The testimony was overwhelmingly supportive of COOL. The hotel parking lot was full of pickup trucks just like mine. They came from Washington, Oregon and Idaho. The corporate participants' jets parked at the airport down the street offered a sharp contrast, just like their opposition to COOL.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rest assured, the issue is not resolved. \r\n\r\nProducers and consumers are united and we will not give in to congressional indifference. COOL remains an issue in the countryside; a top priority issue with National Farmers Union; and we will make sure it continues to be an issue in Congress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Davis is a resident of Coulee City, Wa., and is President of the Washington Farmers Union.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Guest Editorial\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/15/2004\r\n\r\nROBERT DE POSADA\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once again, the U.S. Census found that the number of uninsured Americans has increased, this time to 45 million - an increase of 1.4 million from last year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs the cost of health insurance increases, many employers are dropping coverage, leaving millions of Americans to buy their own coverage. In fact, the same census report found that those covered by employer provided coverage dropped to 60 percent of the population, down from 2003 numbers. This hits the minority community the hardest. Latinos and African-Americans account for more than 50 percent of the uninsured population-one out of every three Latinos is uninsured and about one out of every five African-Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The tax code has favored employer-provided health insurance for the last 60 years, and in that time, this important benefit has enabled most Americans to get health insurance from their employers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Workers who buy their own health insurance are the only people who don't get a tax break when and if they buy health insurance. This year, employer-provided and self-employed health insurance will enjoy a $155 billion tax break. It is fundamentally unfair that workers are discriminated against by the federal tax code in their purchase of health insurance simply because they buy a policy outside their place of employment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the jump in the uninsured, surely there should be political momentum behind helping the uninsured get health insurance. But with the campaign season in full swing, the people who desperately need access to affordable health insurance will have to wait until after the next election to get any help at all, unless Congress does something right away.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nCongress could pass a bill now that would provide relief to workers. This bill, known as \"Fair Care for the Uninsured,\" would provide money for the purchase of health insurance-$1,000 for an individual, $2,000 for a couple, and $3,000 for a family, each year. President Bush has provided funding for this money in his budget.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fair Care would correct the discrimination built into the tax code that currently gives unlimited tax benefits to those who purchase health insurance through their employer, but no tax benefit to the individual purchaser.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The money provided under Fair Care would be advanced to workers up front so that they would have money to buy health insurance, and, according to Fiscal Associates, 18.6 million uninsured people could buy health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During this presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, has suggested other ways to help the uninsured, such as a tax break for small businesses, extending Medicaid to cover low-income children, and enabling workers to buy into health coverage programs for federal employees. However, in 19 years in the Senate, Mr. Kerry has not introduced legislation to address the uninsured crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nBut today he can change that by marching right down to the Senate and adding his name to the Fair Care bill. He doesn't have to wait to make more empty campaign promises. He can make his dream to help the uninsured a reality by immediately supporting this bipartisan legislation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps it's because Senator Kerry is worth $169 million and gets tax-free health insurance from the federal government. The Florida Times-Union indicated in a recent editorial that Mr. Kerry \"may not see it [the uninsured] as a problem. Admittedly, [Fair Care] would not appeal to those who want to turn health care entirely over to the government, hang the cost.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMost politicians think reducing the number of uninsured is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress think Fair Care is a good idea and support the legislation. National groups representing Hispanics, small employers and farmers support Fair Care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While some policymakers would like to consign a large number of America's working poor to Medicaid, or some expanded version of Medicaid in which individuals and families will only get the benefits government officials give them, Fair Care is a superior alternative, which would not bust the federal budget and continue to choke state budgets across the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe best option is to change the tax treatment of health insurance and give low-income working families without health insurance money to help them purchase private health insurance best suited for their families.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert de Posada is president of The Latino Coalition ( www.thelatinocoalition.com), a non-profit, non-partisan organization based in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

In particular they were watching to see that bilingual election workers were available to help out those voters who needed that service.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hazzard handled brief tutorials in the use of the e-slate electronic voting system which is new in the Alderwood County this year.\r\n\"It's really simple if you follow the instructions,\" he said. \"Most people haven't had any trouble with it in our area,\" he added.\r\nWhile election workers heard a few grumblings about the state's new party preference ruling, most people simply stepped into the booths to make their choices.\r\n\r\n\"We have more people turning out this year,\" noted Elaine Kirk, a long-time election worker.\r\n\"I can remember years when we only had 17 voters by noon,\" she said. Kirk said as of 4 p.m. more than 88 voters had passed by her station at Lincoln gym. \"We should be getting a few more after 5 when people get off work,\" she added.\r\n\r\nAccording to post-election survey results issued by Washington Secretary of State Sam Reed, only 21 percent of the state's voters support the new primary system, while 79 percent oppose the system. However, 84 percent of the voters appeared to be confident their votes were being accurately recorded.\r\n\r\nEarly Alderwood County returns showed that of the 17,812 voters who cast ballots in Tuesday's primary election, 62.9 percent voted Republican.\r\nIn Alderwood County, 1.3 percent of the votes were cast by people who voted for the Libertarian candidates on the ballot.\r\n"

Marro said it has been hard for his team to get out of the mode.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We really dropped at the end of the year,\" said Marro. \"It is difficult to keep that intensity level.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro said the last game of the season was also difficult for his team because there wasn't much left to play for, with the Grizzlies being out of the playoffs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a scoreless opening quarter, the Grizzlies pulled ahead 7-0 when Greg Gilleland dashed in from five yards out. Naches, though, answered back, scoring with about 30 seconds left in the first half. Alderwood took a 7-6 lead into the break.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naches went wild in the second half on the Alderwood defense, scoring 25 unanswered points.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We gave up a couple of deep balls and that just gave them life,\" said Marro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood's last touchdown of the year came in the fourth quarter when quarterback Tony Cantu hooked up with Noe Zamarron on a 21-yard touchdown pass.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Grizzlies posted mediocre statistics in the game. Cantu was 4-of-11 in the game for 79 yards. Gilleland had eight rushes for 49 yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro said Naches' defense did a great job of stopping Alderwood's rushing game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rangers also put together an effective ground attack, spreading the ball around between three players for nearly 150 yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They were faster than us,\" said Marro. \"They had the best game of their season.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood finished its season with a Mid-Valley League record of 2-4, good for fifth place. The Grizzlies were 4-6 overall on the year.\r\n"

These are the people who don't realize they are entwined in our existences. They are the people we don't really know, but whom we see almost weekly, maybe daily.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The people I speak of might be that clerk that sells you your soda before you head off to work, greeting you with a friendly \"good morning,\" or the lady at the latte stand, who always asks how your day is going. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's the guy who picks up your garbage, who always has a joke or a chuckle at the ready, or the lady in church whom you smile at and nod to every Sunday, the one who provides you with a brief respite by constantly whispering in her four children's ears to quit scuffling and sit up straight.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These people aren't our family members, most times we can't even call them friends. They're just people, acquaintances so to speak, people who don't realize that they're an integrated part of our lives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We all have such people in our lives. Our understanding of them, and their's of us, is superficial. We present what we want them to see. We really don't know much about each other, other than what can be obtained in the brief moments we share.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most times, we all put on a good front with these types of people. We smile, cordially exchange pleasantries, politely comment on the weather. \r\n\r\nGenerally, we treat them in a manner that is expected to be reciprocated. These aren't the people to whom we vent our built-up frustrations, complain to about the boss at work who's making our lives miserable or chew out for the cruddy dinner that was served up the previous night. No, these are the people we hardly know, yet we are always polite to them, always talk civil to them and always put on our best face for them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why is it that for these people, the ones we barely know, we can always be on our best? But for the people we count on most in our lives, our family, we treat them shamefully at times? We're not always pleasant with our loved ones...we snarl, we grumble, we complain, we question, we yell, we curse. There are times we don't even try to act human with the people who mean the most to us...we don't think to offer up even a flimsy compliment to our wife or husband, or tell our son or daughter what a great job they did in scoring a B on this week's history test. \r\n\r\nInstead, we display our bad sides to our loved ones, on too many occasions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the downfalls of the human species is that we take things for granted. Loved ones fall into that category.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From someone who knows, from someone who regrets their past actions with loved ones and has lamented relationships that are no more, value your family. Put stock in what you have, and treat those who mean the most to you with the utmost respect they deserve."

        "text":"Parazuelan pastor dies watching \"Passion of Christ\"\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 4/23/2004\r\n\r\nPalancia, Parazuela - A Parazuelan pastor died of an apparent heart attack while watching the Mel Gibson film \"The Passion of the Christ,\" witnesses said on Monday.\r\n\r\nJose Santiago, a 43-year-old Presbyterian pastor, had reserved two movie theatres at a Palancia shopping mall on Sunday afternoon to see the film with his family and the congregations of\r\ntwo local churches.\r\n\r\nBut halfway through the movie, Santiago's wife noticed that he was no longer awake. A doctor who was also watching the film tended to Santiago, but the priest was already dead.\r\n\"He was calmly watching the movie next to his wife,\" said Coasta Rica, a family friend who also attended Santiago's funeral on Monday.\r\n\r\nSantiago is at least the second person to die while watching \"The Passion,\" which opened in Brazil on Friday. Peggy Scott, 56, died of a heart attack on February 25 in Wichita, Kansas while watching\r\nfilm's climactic crucifixion scene.\r\n\r\nThe film, which was praised by Catholic leaders in Parazuela as a faithful depiction of events in the Bible, has been criticized by many for its violent and bloody portrayal of Christ's final hours.\r\n"

        "text":"Palacios returns from national motocross race\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/20/2004\r\n\r\nWith age and experience comes wisdom. Case in point, Damon Palacios of Grandview.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Palacios qualified for the American Motocross Association Amateur/Youth National Motocross Championship at Loretta Lynn's ranch in Tennessee Aug. 2-7. Turning 7 in late June, he is now more experienced after being able to compete at a race not too many motocross riders his age get to take part in.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Palacios was one of 42 motocross racers in his classification, the 51cc 4-6 Stock Oil Injection division, to compete for national championship honors. Palacios ended up finishing 36th out of the pack. The field featured motocross riders from all over the United States, including Minnesota, Texas, Florida, California and even Bermuda. Palacios was one of only a couple of riders from Washington state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Palacios qualified for the prestigious national race by winning a Regional qualifying event in Washougal in June.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon's father, Dave, said his son didn't catch much of a break right from the start, getting handed the 38th spot in the gate pick, which put him on the difficult opposite side of the first turn.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was strictly luck of the draw,\" said Dave.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon said he had never raced on a course like the one at Loretta Lynn's estate at Hurricane Mills.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The course was hard,\" said Damon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon added he had never seen so many expert riders as he did at the national championships.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The most difficult spot on the course, said Damon, was an area referred to as \"The 10 Commandments.\" The commandments are a set of 10 hills that riders hit in consecutive stride.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are a lot of ruts on them,\" said Damon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon said the commandments were very chLofferging because as soon as he would come down one hill, he would hit another that would send him shooting back into the air.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon, though, said he was pleased for the most part with how he rode.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dave thought his son did well at the event, even though he said Damon would have liked to done better. Dave said on a couple of the turns his son was dead last and worked his way back through the pack.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides competing, Damon said he had a great time watching the \"big guys\" race. Damon said it was exciting to see them speed around the course.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon also had a good time playing in Hurricane Creek, a river running through Lynn's estate. Damon said he saw all sorts of creatures such as crawfish and frogs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is very kid oriented there,\" said Dave.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dave said Lynn's estate had all kinds of areas dedicated to keeping youngsters busy, including an arcade.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is something a kid would dream of,\" grinned Damon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon also had the opportunity to see two of his idols at the event, motocross riders Bubba Stewart and Ivan Tedesco.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon and his parents took time out during their two-week excursion to see some of the sights along the way. Among the places the family stopped at were Mt. Rushmore, the St. Louis arch, Graceland, the Sears Tower in Chicago, Abraham Lincoln's birthplace and the Crazy Horse memorial. Dave said they also had a chance to tour Lynn's home.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Damon also had the chance to take his first taxi cab ride, which he said was something to experience in a \"big city.\" Damon said his favorite stop on the tour was the Greyhound Hall of Fame in Abilene, Kansas, a museum dedicated to dog racing. Damon said he liked looking at all of the dog items in the museum.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dave said he was very proud of how his son did.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A little better gate pick and he could have easily been in the top 20,\" said Dave.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Palacios said there are a lot of motocross races that a person can compete at, but Lynn's is the biggest one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is by far the most prestigious one to go to,\" said Dave. \"It is kind of like the Rose Bowl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/10/2004\r\n\r\nCouncilman promises sound fiscal decisions\r\nAs a member of the Alderwood City Council, I listened intently Monday night as many citizens stepped up to the podium and made it clear that they are against privatization. A few of those individuals made very poignant arguments, however, the fact of the matter is this, for every city that has had a bad experience with privatization, there is another that has had a good experience.\r\nNow, I am not saying that I am either for or against privatization. What I am saying is that the citizens of Alderwood elected me to be their watchdog, to make sure that I make sound fiscal decisions when it comes to using the city's money. In order to do this, I need to be able to look at all aspects of the city's budget. This includes possible privatization.\r\nGood citizens of Alderwood, I will promise you this, whether or not I vote in favor of privatization, I will never vote for less quality or poorer standards regardless of the cost.\r\n/s/ John Sarducci, City Councilman, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nUntruths about teachers don\u0092t help fix schools\r\nI have had the privilege of getting to know John Panni over the past couple of years in the capacity as a tennis and basketball coach. He does a great job covering our local teams and I find him very likable on a personal level. I was, however, disappointed at some of the things he said in his personal column titled \"Election night headache\" (11-3-04).\r\nI also voted against I-884 because I don't think throwing more money at the education problem is the answer. I would like to see the education system use existing money more effectively. In that sense I agree with Mr. Panni.\r\nHowever, Mr. Panni's discussion of teachers wanting more pay is very off base. He notes that teachers \"work a six-hour day, only work 180 days out of each year, and get to work with children.\" One part of that statement is true, we do get to work with children. This can be a great joy, but it can also be a tremendous struggle to have 150 kids that you are responsible for on multiple levels.\r\nAs a teacher, I take issue with Mr. Panni's comments regarding teacher work hours. The contract for teachers in Alderwood requires that we be at work from 7:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily. If my math is correct, that's seven and a half hours a day, not six. I don't know very many teachers who keep that schedule. Mr. Panni might want to look at the sign-in sheet at the high school, or others for that matter, so he can see the hours that teachers come in to do work for which they are not paid. As a teacher, a 50-hour work week is not uncommon. I have had many full time jobs in my life. Teaching is the most time consuming, mentally taxing and rewarding job of them all!\r\nWhen I got into this profession, money was not a deciding factor. I wanted to have time in the summer to spend with my family. What a dream that was! Not only is my summer taken up with preparing for the next school year, I am required by the state (at my expense) to increase my education. When do you think that is done? So why is there a teaching shortage in many parts of this country?\r\nThe way Mr. Panni described it, you'd think everyone would want to teach. So, here is an open invitation. If being a teacher, advisor and mentor to 150 students daily on a $30,000 a year salary appeals to you, then this is a great job. Oh, you have to use your summers to continue your education on your dime (about $10,000 for me so far in my fourth year).\r\nI love my job and wouldn't trade it for any career. I chose it over law school because of my passion for it. It's just frustrating to read misconceptions like John Panni's, because teachers give their all to a system that has rules that they must live under. Fixing the system should be a priority, but promoting untruths about a teacher's job doesn't help.\r\n/s/ Troy Whittle, Alderwood High School social studies teacher\r\n\u00a0\r\nDon\u0092t destroyour rec programs\r\nI was dismayed to hear that the city manager plans to eliminate the position of parks and recreation manager and divide the responsibilities of that job between the park supervisor and the secretary of the parks and recreation department. Do you believe these two individuals can handle their own duties, plus supervise the community center, museum, senior center, swimming pool, organize the children's soccer and baseball teams and organize the special craft and recreation programs for adults?\r\nAs an example of one event, last year I volunteered to help with the summer track meet. There were 300 participants. This event was held on a Saturday. Would the parks and recreation secretary or park supervisor be able to organize and run all of these track events and also do their regular duties?\r\nThe parks and recreation manager is responsible for the swimming pool programs, events at the senior center and the management of the sports leagues by assigning fields and organizing games. Will the department secretary and park supervisor be able to know what strokes should be taught in the different classifications of swimming classes? Besides their regular duties, will they be able to check on all the sports leagues and their field assignments and organize the league? Will they be present at the senior citizens casino night and participate as dealers?\r\nThe citizens of Alderwood deserve a well organized recreational program that meets the needs of all ages. These activities provide outlets to many who would otherwise not have these advantages. When these programs decline, we will have more juvenile problems and associated negative behaviors.\r\nPlease join me in opposing the decision of the city manager to destroy our progressive recreational program for all people in the city of Alderwood.\r\n/s/ Dorothy L. Aiken, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nSteve Evanswill be missed\r\nThe City of Alderwood will certainly miss Mr. Steve Evans, a long-time member of the police force.\r\nMy family and I had the pleasure of meeting Steve when he came to St. Joseph's Hospital here in Tacoma to witness the birth of his first grandchild, Coven M. Evans Olivas. During his visit he spoke often of \"his town\" with great pride. He exhibited to the community he loved the same caring that he showed his oldest daughter during the difficult birth. His strength, kindness and love helped us all, and we join the City of Alderwood in their fond farewell.\r\nWe will all miss him very much.\r\n/s/ Rosalinda and Ron Olivas, Tacoma\r\n\u00a0\r\nGubernatorial candidate offers thanks to voters\r\nAlthough the governor's race isn't yet decided, I want to take this opportunity to thank the readers of the Alderwood Daily News for their involvement in the democratic process, whether or not they voted for me. It was a long campaign, and I truly enjoyed getting to know the people of Washington.\r\nI also want to express my good wishes to Christine Gregoire and her family. No matter what the outcome of this race, I feel blessed to have had this wonderful experience.\r\nIf I do win, I'll start putting in place my Forward Washington agenda to get our economy going again and help get people back to work. If I don't, I'll consider it one of the greatest honors of my life to have had the opportunity to run for our state's highest office.\r\n/s/ Dino Rossi\r\n\u00a0\r\nBlood drawing very successful\r\nSponsored by the Nouvella Club with Rita Blunk as chairperson, we had a very successful blood drawing on Nov. 2.\r\nThe quota was 70 units. We had 87 presenters and three first-time donors. Ten were unable to give, leaving 77 units collected. Because of their efforts, 231 people will have another chance at life.\r\nMany thanks to the sponsors for donating the cookies and juice, the United Methodist Church for the use of its hall, Bob Story for the great publicity in the Alderwood Daily News and Max of Washington Corrugators for displaying the banner at Centennial Square.\r\nI would like to thank the following volunteers: Ella Mae Lochner, Myrtis Lang, Alice Benedetti, Phyllis Morris, Trude Meadowcroft, Letha Grubb, Lu Ann Roach, Nita Coleman, Lila Furukawa and Ruth Stark.\r\nA very special thank you to the donors, who are the lifeline for the flow of blood in the Valley. We hope to see you at the next blood drawing on Jan. 4, at the United Methodist Church in Alderwood from 1 to 6 p.m.\r\n/s/ Marie Handy, Alderwood\r\n"

All are for Republican candidates.\r\nJust a few days ago a fellow citizen stole my 4'x8' \"Bush for President\" sign in an attempt to, I guess, hide the fact that some people in Washington state will be voting for the President. I am hoping that the person, who undoubtedly is a proponent of free speech as am I, will return the sign with no questions asked.\r\nI also trust that Democrat supporters are not so insecure in their beliefs that they have to resort to theft to get Sen. Kerry elected.\r\n/s/ Herman te Velde, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nDinner organizers appreciate help\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to everyone who helped with and donated to our cancer aid and research seafood dinner and auction held on Sept. 17.

We do hope we have not left anyone out of the list but if we did please accept our apology.\r\nSunnyView VFW Post #3482, Ladies Auxiliary VFW Post #3482, AM VETS Post #3733 and the Men's Auxiliary VFW Post #3482 wish to thank all of you for your support of this very worthy cause.

I do not think you can realize what that meant to me and my family.\r\nIt was a long time ago when I arrived in Alderwood, 1937 to be exact. A skinny 11-year-old boy and not knowing anyone here. My dad died four months later at age 50 after getting pneumonia from working in the fields, and Mom took her bunch of hungry kids and made a living any way we could. We worked in the fields and it did not hurt us any more than it is today.\r\nI have seen Alderwood bloom forward into a proud community by the sweat of many brows, the constitution of the dedicated, the blood of so many young men and faith of what it could become.\r\nI have also seen these dreams die and waver, being replaced with desires of others and overshadowing the original ones. I have seen a community lose its faith in the past and uncertain of its future. I remember the days when the Color Guard and service men marched proudly down our streets in front of our high school band in great spirit and pride. The whole town cheering and waving and having a day of family fun.\r\nIt is sad to think that the era of community spirit is coming to an end. The meaning and memory of how our town was built and why it was built will soon be forgotten and replaced with new ideas not familiar to the founders and their families.\r\nI thank you again for this wonderful honor you gave me for it means more to me than you can imagine. And with this, I want to plead with you to find the community spirit that is still alive in the hearts of those who live here and keep our Sunshine Days alive. Give our kids something to remember in later years. Find the reason it was started and use that as the basis to rekindle the interest. I do not think you will regret it.\r\n/s/ Don and Ruth Bones and family, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nHarvest Dancea huge success\r\nAlderwood Parks and Recreation wants to thank all those who helped make the 2004 Harvest Dance, held on Sunday, Oct. 3, a huge success.\r\nThank you to the Alderwood School District and Dennis Birr, the high school principal, for the use of the school gym. Thanks to the VICA Club members who attended, served refreshments and danced with the guests. Special thanks go to VICA advisors Karen Schrontz and Nick Paulakis.\r\nA big round of applause to Bill Holden and his four-piece band for their great dancing music.\r\nAdditional thanks to the Alderwood senior group and to volunteer Sherre Ott-Holden for all her help, not only on this program but many parks and recreation programs.\r\nAnd last but not least, thank to all 94 paricipants who attended the fourth annual Harvest Dance.\r\n/s/ Don Stiles, director, Alderwood Parks and Recreation Department & Joan Niemeyer, assistant\r\n\u00a0"

        "text":"School problems focus of legislative dinner\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/19/2004\r\n\r\nAdministrators and school board members from school districts in the 15th Legislative District addressed concerns they have when it comes to the future of education in the state of Washington, Monday night at the Lower Valley School Board/Legislative Dinner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a015th District Sen. Jim Honeyford and Representatives Bruce Chandler and Dan Newhouse also talked about concerns they have with the WASL, school funding, charter schools and the future of education in the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIan Grabenhorst, assistant superintendent for ESD 105, listed some concerns the educational district holds. Amongst the educational priorities Grabenhorst outlined were a focus on amply funding K-12 education. He suggested the state complete a comprehensive review of the finance system and establish a sustainable, predictable and fair state funded system for public schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making a constitutional amendment that would allow school districts to pass a levy with a simple majority is also key to better education in Washington, said Grabenhorst.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He asked the state legislators to consider repealing unfunded mandates, which are difficult to implement without funding in place.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We have requests that are set in front of our districts and no funding,\" said Grabenhorst.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHe also asked the legislators to oppose binding arbitration and to reinforce the state's \"no strike\" laws.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sen. Honeyford, in his opening comments, said one of the major issues facing the legislature this budget cycle is money.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We'll have at least a $1 billion deficit, plus collective bargaining. We'll probably be a billion-two upside down to start with,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He explained that K-12 education receives about 43 percent of the state's budget and another 10 percent goes to higher education. Corrections receives about 30 percent, leaving the state with about 20 percent of the money as discretionary.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honeyford said they have had difficulties getting the votes to make strikes illegal, but they are still working on it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said he believes that questions about the WASL will once again return to the state level this next year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The WASL to some people is the holy grail to end education problems,\" said Honeyford. \"I don't like it. It's terribly expensive for what we get.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another concern is non-English speakers and the disabled taking the test.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nChandler takes a different view on the test. He believes there has to be some kind of benchmark or test to see the educational growth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I believe at the end of the day most students will achieve our expectations of them,\" he said. \"If we expect great things they will rise to that.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He added that he believes there is a lot to be said for better than average students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chandler said a K-12 task force has been looking at education in the state and one of the areas it found of interest is special education funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In areas some districts are making money on it and others are in the hole,\" said Chandler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chandler said if Initiative 884 going before voters to help fund public education is passed it will be the highest tax increase in the history of the state. He said that if the initiative fails that most likely the legislators will be reluctant to increase taxes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If it passes it will probably be the only tax increase passed mainly because of its size,\" said Chandler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A concern Chandler has with the initiative is that if the 1 percent increase in retail sales tax for K-12 education is put in a fund and decided upon by a citizen oversight committee, he foresees the legislature having very little input on public education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne of Newhouse's main concerns is the class of 2008 being required to pass the WASL to graduate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's concern about the dropout rate if we don't do anything about it,\" said Newhouse.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, some changes may be afoot at the state level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Currently, there are 25 Republicans in the Senate and 24 Democrats. With four close races, Honeyford feels it's too close to call what it will be like next year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The House of Representatives has 52 Democrats and 46 Republicans.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That six-vote difference was determined in the last election by 1,700 people,\" said Chandler. \"This year we expect voter turnout to exceed 70 percent. Ten percent of voters in Yakima County could be new voters, which creates a lot of uncertainty.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Local pastor and a member of the Alderwood School District's ethics committee, Ron Jetter, addressed the trend to combat obesity at the school level by banning certain foods and beverages from school grounds. He asked if the legislators anticipate a state law that would ban certain foods.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chandler said that last year two bills in the House addressed child obesity. One of the bills would have banned certain foods from being sold on school grounds. The other, known as the \"Fat Tax,\" would have taxed foods based on ingredients. The problem, he said, is that some candy bars would be taxed and others wouldn't.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chandler anticipates at least one proposal this year, but he would much rather leave it at the school board level.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In all, the legislators are looking forward to an interesting session. \r\n\r\nThey said they appreciated the input from those who are on the front line of education, which helps them in their decision making process in Olympia.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The light at the end of the tunnel, Honeyford added at the end, is that the economic downfall the state has been experiencing is expected to end in 2009. He anticipates programs that have been neglected with funding, such as education, will receive more funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.

        "text":"Plan in place to monitor spread of BSE in United States\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/21/2004\r\n\r\nPROSSER - Dr. Rory Meyer of the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, a division of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), was the featured speaker at the Washington State University Research Center in Prosser Thursday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMeyer spoke about a testing program USDA has in place to test cattle for Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), better known as \"Mad Cow\" disease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BSE had been a problem in England for more than a decade, where the cattle supply was nearly annihilated. The BSE problem came to North America first hitting the United States in December 2001 when a cow in nearby Alderwood was diagnosed with the disease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BSE is a neurological disease in cattle. The disease is mainly passed in cattle by feed. However, the disease can also be passed genetically, said Meyer. Until bans were put into place on the type of feed that could be used, cattle were fed meat and bone meal to help provide the animals with needed protein and calcium.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meyer said the USDA and other agencies spent six to seven weeks investigating the first BSE case to ever hit the United States. Meyer said that the BSE cow in Alderwood, which was exported from Canada, and the cow with BSE found in Alberta, Canada, at one time were kept within 50 to 100 miles of each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMeyer, though, said the risk is extremely low for BSE to become a problem in the U.S. like it was in England. He cited a 2001 study done by Harvard University that said with all the safety measures the United States has in place to prevent BSE, the risk for the disease to spread like it did in England is extremely low.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Even if we were to get it, with all the bans we have in place it should phase out,\" said Meyer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to help ensure consumer confidence and to find out where the BSE situation stands in the United States, USDA has begun a BSE testing program, said Meyer. The program will be overseen by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) division within USDA. Meyer said the testing program will be across the country, lasting between 12 and 18 months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The program began this past June, Meyer said, and will be a one-time effort by USDA. The program is meant to see if BSE is present in the cattle industry and if so at what levels.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the program, USDA will assist cattle farmers with any cost of participating in the program. USDA officials will only be testing cattle in the high-risk population, meaning non-ambulatory cattle, cattle exhibiting signs of a central nervous disorder, cattle exhibiting signs associated with BSE and dead cattle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"If we are going to find them (cattle with BSE), we are going to find them in that high-risk category,\" said Meyer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meyer said the program will be targeting cattle older than 30 months. Meyer said the target age is older because cattle can carry the BSE disease up to 90 months.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0USDA will be working with officials at slaughter houses, farms and livestock auctions to find cattle in the high-risk population, as well as cattle farmers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meyer said there is also a tracking system for cattle that makes it easy to trace back where the animals came from.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Testing of animals will be done using ELISA, which is a rapid screening test that gives officials quick results. USDA is working with various laboratories across the country, including in Washington state, to provide test results. Meyers said any inconclusive results will be double-checked at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Iowa.\r\n"

        "text":"Guest Editorial\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/1/2004\r\n\r\nKAREN LYTLE BLAHA\r\n\r\nGenial journalist and commentator Christopher Matthews dubs them the \"homework wars\"-the tussle to get your kids to do their homework. Sometimes contentious, it's a tussle worth taking on to make strides in academic achievement. As kids move up in grade levels, the gap in test scores widens between kids who do homework and those who don't, according to a free booklet from the U.S. Department of Education.\r\n\r\nThe booklet, Questions Parents Ask About Schools, is chock full of tips for parents. Among them:\r\n\r\n? The right amount of homework depends on the age and skills of the child... (Some say that) children in kindergarten through second grade can benefit from 10 to 20 minutes of homework each school day. In third through sixth grades, children can benefit from 30 to 60 minutes a day.\r\n\r\n? Talk with your child's teacher about homework policies. Make sure you know the purpose of assignments, how long they should take, and how the teacher wants you to be involved in helping your child complete them.\r\n\r\n? Agree with your child on a set time to do homework every day.\r\n\r\n? Talk with your child about assignments to see that she or he understands them.\r\n\r\n? If you are unable to help your child with a subject, ask for help from a relative. Also see if the school, library or a community or religious organization can provide tutoring or homework help.\r\n\r\n? Check to see that your child has done all the work assigned.\r\n\r\n? Watch for signs of frustration or failure. Let your child take a short break if he or she is having trouble keeping their mind on an assignment.\r\n\r\n? Reward progress. If your child has been successful in completing an assignment and is working hard, celebrate with a special event: reading a favorite story or playing a game together-to reinforce the positive effort.\r\n\r\n? Read the teacher's comments on assignments that are returned. If a problem comes up, arrange to meet with the teacher and work out a plan and a schedule to solve it.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of parents getting involved with homework is that they learn more about what their children are learning. It's an occasion to talk with the kids about the subject matter, and it gives parents a better foundation to communicate with teachers.\r\n\r\nQuestions Parents Ask About Schools can be downloaded from the U.S. Department of Education Web site (www.ed.gov),or [www.ed.gov),or ordered from ED Pubs, Education Publications Center, U.S. Department of Education, P.O.

        "text":"Two 4A teams beat Alderwood girls\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/15/2004\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood High School girls fastpitch softball team had its hands full this past Saturday. In the 2004 spring openers, the Lady Grizzlies were clipped by a pair of strong Class 4A schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Enumclaw Hornets, which advanced to the State tournament last spring, edged the Class 3A Lady Grizzlies 7-3 in the first of three games played in Alderwood on Saturday. Spanaway Lake swept the afternoon doubleheader from Alderwood, winning 5-0 and 28-15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood Coach Kris Gonzalez said despite sustaining the three losses Saturday, she remains optimistic the Lady Grizzlies will fare well this season.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We're young, we only have one senior on the varsity. Considering who we played Saturday, I thought the girls performed well,\" said Gonzalez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Especially on offense,\" she continued. \"Last year at this time of the season, we were only coming up with one or two hits a game. But we had three hits against Enumclaw, then five hits and nine hits in the two late games against Spanaway Lake,\" Gonzalez said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe last of the three games played Saturday, won 28-15 by Spanaway Lake, there was a total of 26 hits.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think fatigue kicked in,\" said Gonzalez,\" explaining the two clubs committed a total of 15 errors. Between the tiring arms of the opposing pitchers and the fielding miscues, the final tally more resembled a football score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood's top guns at the plate in the Spanaway Lake nightcap were Crystal Soto and Jessica Serl. Soto had a double in the second inning and an RBI single in the third enroute to posting a 3-for-3 effort at the plate. Serl added a 2-for-2 offensive performance for the Lady Grizzlies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spanaway Lake's top hitter in the twin bill finale was its pitcher, Kilgore, who went 4-for-5 by slapping four singles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kilgore had a 2-for-3 performance in the opener against Alderwood, which included socking a solo home run in the top of the seventh.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serl was 1-for-3 in the 5-0 loss to Spanaway Lake.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gonzalez said none of her Lady Grizzlies advanced past second base in the opening game against Spanaway Lake.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We came through with five hits against them, but we left them all stranded,\" said Gonzalez. \"We made some base running errors.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the day's first game against Enumclaw, the Lady Grizzlies scratched out three runs in the bottom of the third, and were ahead 3-1 heading into the top of the fifth frame. The Hornets exploded for five runs in the fifth, though, blanking Alderwood through the final four innings enroute to scoring their come-from-behind 7-3 victory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood's three-run third began with Lacey Yanez drawing a walk. Yanez ended up scoring on her own, as she stole second and advanced two more bases on two passed balls. Following a strikeout, Jessica Cruz drew another walk for the Lady Grizzlies, moving to second on yet another passed ball. Following the second strikeout of the inning, Jenny Wells clutched up and drove in Cruz with a single. Serl closed out the scoring for Alderwood by lashing an RBI double to plate Wells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pitching-wise for Alderwood, Erika Martinez went the distance in the opener against Enumclaw. She scattered 10 hits in the 7-3 loss, giving up five walks along the way while fanning one. Martinez (0-2) also took the loss in the nightcap against Spanaway Lake, pitching the first three innings. She departed the pitching rubber with her club trailing by a 23-12 count. Viri Pasillas pitched all of the opening game against Spanaway Lake, limiting Alderwood's 4A opponent to just five hits. She walked only three. Pasillas (0-1) was touched for five runs in the last two innings she pitched against Spanaway Lake in the second game of the twin bill.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In looking ahead to the remainder of the season, Gonzalez said she has everyone back off last year's squad with the exception of Sonya Ramos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Those will be some difficult shoes to fill,\" Gonzalez said of her shortstop's departure, \"But we're a year older and a year more experienced.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think we're going to be alright,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serl will be replacing Ramos at short, and based on how she played this past Saturday, Gonzalez said Serl should fill in nicely there.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe one other change the Lady Grizzlies must make this spring is at third. Emily Wells had been penciled in to play the hot corner, but she suffered a broken ankle in practice and most likely will miss the rest of the season. Gonzalez brought up Eleanor Martinez from the JV this past Saturday, and she filled in there as well as could have been expected. Gonzalez said Martinez was a second baseman on the JV, so will need some time to make the adjustment at third.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood's varsity is scheduled to take on visiting Kiona-Benton in a single game this coming Thursday, beginning at 3:30 p.m.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Voters being asked to maintain Alderwood's quality of life\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 2/18/2004\r\n\r\nA library is an important piece of any community. It serves as a place to gather information, peruse different magazines and newspapers, offers a wide selection of reading materials and can also be a site from which to search for your favorite musical group on the internet. According to Alderwood Valley Regional Library Director Monica Weyhe, libraries play such an important role in a community that realtors often include information on libraries, alongside information on public schools when talking to perspective home buyers.\r\n\r\n\"It brings a quality of life to the community,\" Weyhe said.\r\n\r\nThat quality of life in Alderwood is currently being threatened. Voters are being asked to approve a ballot measure on March 9 that if approved, will annex the local library into the Alderwood Valley Regional Library system. A yes vote, in effect, will keep the doors to the local library open.\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood Public Library currently contracts with the Alderwood Valley Regional Library for library services and materials. The City of Alderwood owns the library building. But, it is the regional library system that provides staff members, computers and other materials, such as the summer reading program, for the local site.\r\n\r\nThe city currently pays $115,000 annually to the Alderwood Valley Regional Library for its services. If the annexation proposal passes it will go into effect January 2005, and the regional library will reduce the annual fee for 2004 to $65,000, which is the amount set aside for the library in the city's 2004 budget.\r\n\r\nHowever, it costs more than the annual fee of $115,000 a year to operate the Alderwood library. According to Alderwood Valley Regional Library officials, in 2004 it will cost approximately $369,825 to operate the local library, which includes the cost of staff members, supplies and children's services. Besides the $115,000 paid by the city, much of the money to operate the Alderwood Public Library is collected from people living in the unincorporated areas of Alderwood County, whose residents pay 49.6\u00a2 per $1,000 of assessed property value.\r\n\r\nOther local communities that have annexed into and are now part of the Rural Library District include Toppenish, Wapato, Zillah, Harrah and Moxee. The communities of Buena, Nile, Terrace Heights and White Swan are part of the Rural Library District because they are located in the unincorporated areas of Alderwood County.\r\n\r\nWeyhe explained that just outside the Alderwood city limits county residents are already paying the Rural Library District rate of 49.6\u00a2 per $1,000 of assessed property value. This is the rate Alderwood city residents will pay if voters approve the annexation of the Alderwood Public Library into the Alderwood Valley Regional Library system on March 9.\r\n\r\n\"Your neighbors are already paying at the library levy rate,\" Weyhe said.\r\n\r\nShe said the annexation will give the Alderwood library a more stable source of funding, as well as provide for some improvements to the local facility. She said upon the annexation of the Alderwood library, there will likely be more funds available to put into things such as the library's infrastructure, books and other services the local facility offers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the library serves 2,437 people who have been issued library cards, and offers services ranging from internet access to research assistance. The Alderwood facility offers a vast collection of fiction and non-fiction books for the entire family, as well as large print and Spanish language selections. Kay Saunders, Alderwood librarian, said the local facility also offers a variety of services, including internet classes in English and Spanish, story time for small children, a summer reading program for all ages, books on tape and CD, as well as musical cassettes and CDs and movies, both fiction and non-fiction for all ages.\r\n\r\nSaunders said the local library also offers those who visit a chance to glance through an array of newspapers and magazines, as well as a chance to seek help from five library staff members.\r\n\r\n\"They are a rich source of local information,\" Saunders said.\r\n\r\nFor local resident Pat Kezele, Friends of the Library chairman, having access to a library facility like the one offered in Alderwood is important. She said libraries are public places that are used by everyone, no matter their age.\r\n\r\n\"The public library is for all ages,\" Weyhe said.\r\n\r\nWeyhe explained that the Alderwood Public Library was founded in 1911 with a Carnegie Grant. She said the reason Andrew Carnegie set up the grants was because he felt libraries were the \"people's university.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have always felt it was a community building,\" said Alderwood resident Bettie Siliano during a recent meeting of the Friends of the Library Committee. \"Can you imagine the community without the library?\" asked Bettie's husband, Frank Siliano.\r\n\r\nFor Beatrice and Jose A. Villanueva, who live next door to the library, having the facility in such close proximity was a perk while they raised their children.\r\n\r\n\"It was nice for them to go over and do their homework at the library,\" Beatrice said.\r\n\r\nThe Villanuevas, Silianos and Kezele make up a group of approximately 35 committee members who are working to distribute information about the upcoming annexation election.\r\n\r\nWeyhe said in order for the annexation measure to pass it must be approved by voters with a simple majority, which means 50 percent plus one person.\r\n\r\nKezele explained that if the ballot measure does not pass, Alderwood residents will lose access to library services.\r\n\r\n\"People in the city will not be able to get a regional card,\" Kezele said.\r\n\r\nWeyhe said if voters do not approve the annexation there will not be enough tax base to continue operation of the Alderwood library. She said at a cost of 49.6\u00a2 per $1,000 of assessed property value, a person with a $100,000 home will pay $49.60 a year to the Rural Library District. She said if the ballot measure passes that equals out to roughly $4 a month.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that they will see the value in that,\" Weyhe said.\r\n\r\nShe said the Alderwood library is considered the regional library center of the Lower Valley.\r\n\r\n\"It's really an important center,\" Weyhe said. \"It's hard to think about such a busy regional center closing.\"\r\n\r\nAlderwood residents will have a chance to voice their opinion on the library annexation Tuesday, March 9, in the special election. Those residents voting absentee must mail in their ballot between Feb. 18 and March 9.\r\n"

        "text":"City council learns some are against privatizing public works\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/10/2004\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood City Council has said all along that it can't hurt to at least hear presentations from different companies about privatizing the city's public works department in order to save taxpayers money.\r\n\r\nThis past Monday night, Council heard an earful from several residents who adamantly oppose privatizing city services.\r\n\r\nThe city is currently in talks with three companies about possibly privatizing Alderwood's public works department. Council is expected to address the matter later this year or early next year.\r\n\r\nAlderwood resident Bruce Epps told Council he has spoken with a number of residents who are against privatizing city services.\r\n\"If you have researched this at all, you have found a lot of towns with problems,\" said Epps.\r\nEpps cited the fact that the City of Bremerton recently took back operation of its water and sewer system from a private firm. Epps said Bremerton officials took back the system because the private firm left operations in disarray. Epps said residents in Bremerton had to endure a 12 percent increase in water and sewer rates every year during the four years the service was operated by a private firm.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to take this out of house,\" said Epps in regards to privatizing Alderwood's public works department.\r\n\r\nEpps cautioned Council members that they are going to meet opposition to privatizing city services.\r\n\r\n\"I think you are going to find a lot of people irate over it,\" said Epps.\r\n\r\nJay Alvarez expressed to Council that operating such services as water and sewer should fall under the responsibility of the government.\r\n\r\nAlvarez said that privatizing the public works department may lead to a lower quality of water being distributed to city residents. Alvarez also said he feels that national companies don't have a stake in the smaller communities, such as Alderwood, and won't do as good a job.\r\n\r\n\"You guys have a duty here,\" said Alvarez. \"We definitely need to look into this deeper.\"\r\nCouncilwoman Jennie Angel said she has received a number of negative comments from community members about privatization.\r\n\"I haven't had one citizen approach me who thinks it is a good idea,\" said Angel. \"The citizens of Alderwood are not pleased and we need to listen to our citizens.\"\r\n\r\nCouncilman John Torch pointed out the city's governing body is simply considering options, and asked how does it hurt to hear presentations from the different companies. Torch said the city has no idea what the cost benefits to privatizing the public works department will be for residents.\r\n\"The way to know is to have (these) firms make a presentation,\" said Torch.\r\nTorch added that Council will be looking for citizen input when the time arrives.\r\n\r\nSandra Martinez, who is a small business owner in Alderwood, said she likes being able to know she can quickly get the assistance of the local public works department and doesn't want to see a private firm come into town. Martinez said she doesn't think it is fair to the employees of the public works department, their families, residents and business owners to be in a waiting mode while decisions are being made about privatizing the public works department.\r\n\r\nWayne Johnson, teamsters representative for the public works department, presented Council with a letter from the wastewater manager in Bremerton dated Oct. 13, 2004. Johnson read the letter to Council, detailing how privatization would be a mistake. The letter detailed how the residents of Alderwood would be the \"losers\" if Council did decide to privatize the public works department.\r\n\r\nMayor Rex Luthor told the audience that staff is currently dealing with the matter and will be making a presentation to Council at a later date. Luthor said at which time Council will be taking into consideration all of the public's concerns about privatization.\r\n\r\nEpps ended the discussion by saying this won't be the last time Council hears from the public about privatizing city services.\r\n\r\n"

The escalating conflict has caused the mostly indigenous and Afro-Colombian population to flee repeatedly along the Opogado, Napipi and other tributaries of the Atrato River.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the displaced communities, UNHCR and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) sent follow-up missions to Opogado and Loma de Bojaya, where the most urgent needs were for clean water, sanitation and medical assistance. The Colombian Government also sent food to Loma de Bojaya, UNHCR said.\r\n\r\n\"The displacement comes nearly two years after the massacre of 119 people sheltering in a church inBojaya in this same area and puts Bojaya again at the epicentre of a growing humanitarian crisis,\" UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said at a news briefing in Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe refugee agency supports indigenous and Afro-Colombian organizations in the area, considered the poorest in Colombia, through training, documentation campaigns and funding for community initiatives, UNHCR said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in southwestern Colombia, hundreds of people have crossed and recrossed the border with Ecuador, according to whether fighting between the Colombian army and FARC guerrillas intensified or lessened in recent weeks.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/29/2004\r\n\r\nOnce again Alderwood is made to look like a joke to the rest of Yakima County. I am referring to the little poem by our local councilman, John Torch, in the latest editions of the Yakima Valley Business Times and the Alderwood Daily News.\r\nMr. Torch, please start concerning yourself with city issues and quit bad mouthing agencies that don't agree with your sanctimonious views. Not all of Alderwood agrees with you.\r\nMaybe you should try working with the other agencies and stop with the \"If it's not my way, hit the hiway\" attitude. That attitude alone has cost the city in revenue dollars. No wonder people give our city a wide berth when it comes to relocating businesses and opportunities.\r\nAnd to Sue and Rob Rice, congratulations on your new business. It will definitely be a great asset to the Lower Valley. I wish you both nothing but success.\r\n/s/ Patty S. Denson, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nRockford great city manager\r\nI find it most interesting talking to citizens of Alderwood. The populace of Alderwood has so many opinions on so many subjects concerning our fine city.\r\nRecently, everywhere I go I hear people talking about the purchase of the Monson feedlot. Several people say the purchase was the right thing to do, but they should have bought the mill, too. Others say it was a waste to have bought it at all.\r\nWell, to me it doesn't matter. The smell of manure to me is much more refreshing than most of this perfume women wear. But if this community wants to move forward and not become stagnant as far as economic development goes, it was the right move.\r\nIt seems as though being the city manager surely must be a thankless job. Tom Rockford has done more for this city as far as economic development goes than any manager in the last 20 years. He has grabbed the reins and led the way. I am not saying the others weren't good managers. The others were more appeasing type managers.\r\nIt just seems to me that some groups of people in town want their projects done immediately. This city has fallen so far behind in the last decade that it will take time to get to where we should be. I personally think Rockford is a great manager and we will see some great movement forward with this city manager.\r\nBut for you that don't, I am setting up a collection at the intersection of Sixth and Edison. Just throw your money in that manhole. I will collect the money and buy Rockford a magic wand!\r\n/s/ Don Padelford, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nImage vs. character\r\nRecently, a contributor to this Forum column wrote in espousing the \"presidential charisma\" of candidate Kerry. He specifically referred to how well Mr. Kerry looked and acted in the third presidential debate. The writer seemed to be most impacted by the image Sen. Kerry portrayed.\r\nIn this media saturated culture it seems that image is \"everything.\" Granted, looks are important but when it comes to picking a president for our nation we need to look beyond the pretty package.\r\nIf we look back at two examples of previous presidents, we can point to glaringly stark contrasts. Remember Ronald Regan. What a gentleman. A man with rock-solid principles, a fantastic marriage and a man whose word was as good as his handshake. Even his enemies, such as Gorbachev, came to respect him.\r\nContrast Reagan with Bill Clinton. Even before he won the presidency, a parade of \"bimbos\" gave witness to Clinton's marital indiscretions. Foreign leaders mocked him behind his back. As Commander in Chief, Clinton gutted the military. For example, he reduced active Air Force personnel from 650,000 to 240,000 people during his two terms. Many of the best officers voluntarily took early retirement rather than serve under a man they could not respect. And then to top it all, he lied in court and to the American people. His own state took away his license to practice law.\r\nSo what does this have to do with the 2004 election?\r\nPresident Bush is a man of his word. He has principles and integrity. He stands for what he believes. Our military loves him as Commander in Chief. And he has a fantastic marriage.\r\nThen there's Sen. Kerry. Fresh from his four-month tour (others served one year) in Vietnam, he went before a Congressional hearing and confessed to war crimes while still a commissioned officer. Then he accused those he served with of crimes against civilians without one shred of evidence. He has voted against bills supporting new weapons and funding for the military. Yet, he claims that he has all the qualities to instill loyalty by our soldiers who daily lay their lives on the line to defend us from those who want to kill us and take our freedom. Give me a break!\r\nFinally, I want to remind my neighbors how ancient Israel's leader, David, was chosen. After all of Jessee's handsome sons had been paraded before Samuel, one little shepherd boy became one of the greatest kings in all history. When Samuel asked God why He chose David, God told Samuel that \"Men look on the outside (image) of a man, but the Lord looks on the heart (character) of a man.\"\r\n/s/ Rick Herndon, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nDefending Kerry an attack on Vietnam veterans\r\nI was watching TV the other night when a representative from the Veterans Administration was asked whether Sen. John Kerry was telling the truth in 1971, or whether the \"Swift Vets for Truth\" were. This man said that John Kerry was telling the truth.\r\nI was shocked. My understanding is that even Kerry has said that he had no firm knowledge of atrocities to back up what he said back in 1971. He admits that he stretched the truth. So why would one of our representatives say that Kerry told the truth.\r\nI was in college in 1971 and I remember how hard it hit me when Kerry told those lies. I also remember that Congress was so upset by what Kerry had told them that they called in Telford Taylor from Columbia Law University in New York to investigate the atrocities being committed in Vietnam. You might recall that Taylor was the chief prosecutor during the War Crimes Trials in Nuremberg, Germany at the end of WWII.\r\nAfter Taylor's investigation he said that he found very few cases of true atrocities taking place in Vietnam. He did say that many times our soldiers had killed civilians, but in almost every case he investigated he found that it was not an atrocity at all. He said that these incidents were very sad and hard for soldiers to deal with, but they were not a crime according to the Geneva Convention. The civilians were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that the aim was not to kill the civilians just for the joy of it. In fact, most soldiers felt guilty for having killed innocent people during firefights. It was not their intent.\r\nIn the end Taylor said the Rules of Engagement were impeccable. He said the Rules of Engagement were so impeccable that he found it difficult to believe that soldiers would follow them, as it would cost them their lives to do so. Taylor said that the way in which we fought the war caused many soldiers to lose their lives, in order that civilians would be spared theirs. And he said that he felt that was unacceptable during war. In the end he said the Vietnam War was the cleanest war that America had ever fought; that it had the fewest atrocities by any measure compared to other wars; and that he found a renewed sense of awe for those who were fighting the war, even though he was firmly against it.\r\nTo my knowledge no one has disputed Taylor's assessment of the war with regards to war crimes having been committed by our troops, so why would one of our representatives say that Kerry was \"right\" back in 1971, referring to our fellow soldiers as war criminals?\r\nI think John Kerry threw gasoline on the fire back in 1971. He convinced people that Jane Fonda was right. And that caused the war protesters to harass the returning soldiers on college campuses at a higher level than what they had been doing before. I know, I was there. After Kerry spoke to Congress in 1971 it was very ugly for the veterans who were attending college and trying to further their education.\r\nIn 1971 I remember watching (from afar) an anti-war rally on campus one day, and watched as the students cheered when it was announced how many returing Vietnam veterans had committed suicide after coming home. They truly wanted to see us dead. Their level of cruelty was more brutal than any acts by infantry soldiers that I had ever seen.\r\nThe question remains: why doesn't John Kerry go on TV and debate these Swift Boat Veterans, and the POWs and the recipients of the Medal of Honor that have spoken out against him on TV ads? He could end this whole debate once and for all. He's a very good debater. He had the courage to debate George Bush, so why not do all Vietnam veterans a great favor and debate these men as well? They have proven to be honorable men, thus I would like him to step up to the plate and discuss this whole matter on national TV.\r\nThat doesn't sound like much to me, especially if Kerry thinks he's right.\r\nI wish he would either defend himself against these veterans, or apologize for what he did. My view is that he needs to apologize for the lies he told, and the damage that those lies did to Vietnam veterans. And he especially needs to apologize to family members of those returning Vietnam veterans who committed suicide when they were unable to stand up to the attacks committed on them by their peers. It must be remembered that these veterans returned home physically fatigued, mentally fatigued and spiritually fatigued. They required nurturing, not the attacks hurled at them.\r\nBut still today people come to the defense of John Kerry and encourage others to continue to attack our veterans. For any defense of John Kerry is an attack on those who honorably served in Vietnam, and who say that they are proud of their service in Vietnam, and who also say that they would serve again if asked.\r\n/s/ Greg Schlieve, Vietnam veteran, Grandview\r\n\u00a0"

        "text":"Spring athletes honored at awards ceremony\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 6/2/2004\r\n\r\nEnding a successful spring sports season on a high note with state berths in tennis, golf and track, and strong finishes in soccer and baseball, the young athletes were honored at the Alderwood High School Spring Sports Banquet Tuesday night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nRick Van de Graaf of the Alderwood Athletic Club presented the 2004 Spring Athletic Scholar Athlete academic awards to the students with the top grade point average in their sports program. First time recipients of the honor were presented with a patch and those who had earned the honor before were presented a pin. To be eligible for the award students must be enrolled in at least three classes at Alderwood High School, said Van de Graaf.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In soccer Luis Galvan was awarded a patch for having the highest GPA for the varsity team and Pedro Velez for the jr. varsity team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nGirls varsity tennis player Lizeth Chiprez received a pin as did jr. varsity player Brionna Hughes. Jr. varsity player Dionne Cohan earned a patch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Beals, boys varsity tennis player, earned a pin and jr. varsity tennis player Jesus Alquicira received a patch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Girls golfer Christine Kim earned a patch and boys golfer Kevin Lick received a pin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Girls trackster Isley Gonzalez received a pin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In boys track there was a four-way tie, said Van de Graaf. Pins were awarded to Jeff Davis, Brendon Scott and Joe Schwartz. Mitch Lathen earned a patch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Varsity softball player Emily Wells received a pin. Jr. varsity player Julie Taylor earned a patch as did C squad player Laura Aguiar, said Van de Graaf.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood High School soccer coach Juan Pineda started off presenting the individual team awards to outstanding athletes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With 70 percent of the team scoring points this year, Pineda said the team had \"glorious moments this season.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Receiving the award for Most Inspirational Player was Johnny Hernandez, whom Pineda nicknamed late in the season \"the octopus.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda said Hernandez is a goal keeper who worked hard in past years to get better even when he wasn't able to give him a lot of playing time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe award for Most Improved was presented to Kyle Van de Graaf, whom Pineda said brought a lot of height to the team this year. He said Van de Graaf was able to bring the ball down and that he was an asset to the team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Described as \"a quiet player with magic in his feet,\" Luis Galvan was awarded the Captains award.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He made a lot of decisions on the field when I can't be there,\" said Pineda, adding that Galvan's quick thinking is part of the reason the team made it to the quarterfinals this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Coaches Award was presented to Rafael Diego, who Pineda said is the type of player that radiates a lot of humbleness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He has a humble spirit and is always ready to apply or do the functions we ask him to do,\" said Pineda. \"He's an all-around player, great on defense and great in forward positions.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Receiving the award for Most Valuable Player was Junior Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He was born with a special gift in his feet,\" said Pineda. \"He needs to use his feet for more than just getting on the bus.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Head baseball coach Dave Martinez described the 2004 baseball team as having desire, commitment and hard work, which is what made the team successful this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The team tied the school record for the most wins and advanced to the Regional play-offs for the first time in school history, said Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Coaches Award was presented to Micah Zakahi, who has been part of the varsity baseball program for the past four years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He's the guy we went to when we wanted a win,\" said Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nReceiving the Inspirational Award was Michael Sanchez, a four-year veteran of the Alderwood baseball program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A player with hopes of becoming a coach in the future was the winner of the Captains Award. R.J. Elizondo has led the team for the past two years both on and off the field, said Martinez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The winner of the Most Improved award was presented to high school junior Chris Newberry, who raised his batting average 200 points in one year, said Martinez. Newberry was one of the lower batters last year, but is now the number 3 batter on the team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Most Valuable Player award was presented to Derek Uberuaga, who nailed a two-run homer late in the season giving the Alderwood team the lead needed to move forward in their quest for State.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood girls track and field coach Robin Bryson presented the Most Inspirational Award to Daniela Rivera, whom Bryson said is always smiling and willing to step up and do whatever is asked of her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Districts and Regionals, she was asked to step up and run the 4x400 relay and also run the 4x200, which are run with, at the most, 30 minutes between races.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Improved was presented to AHS sophomore Fatima Ruelas, who ran the 100, 200, 4x100, 4x200 and ventured into long jump and triple jump this season.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outstanding Performer was presented to Hilary Van de Graaf for her four years of consistent performance for the track team.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Coaches Award was presented to Isley Gonzalez, who Bryson said, \"over the four years she's never ceased to amaze me.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a freshman she placed second at State and quickly became the person to beat in 3A distance running. With extra training in the off season, Gonzalez was able to win the State cross country title this past fall and a State track title this spring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third year trackster Brenden Scott was presented the Most Inspirational Award by Coach Wally Shearer last night. Shearer said that Scott was disqualified at the District meet and was very upset and disappointed, but filled in on a relay the same day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nExchange student Branimir Janjevic was presented Most Improved. Competing in the high jump, long jump and triple jump, for the first time, Janjevic qualified for the Regional track meet this spring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The award for Outstanding Performer was presented to Luke Schilperoort, who accumulated the most meet points for Alderwood this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Coaches Award was presented to senior Jeff Davis, who \"...was always about the team,\" said Shearer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He was always willing to step in and help in a relay,\" said Shearer, \"even if it was going to hurt his individual record. It was never about him, it was about the team.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Varsity golf coach Glenn Braman presented the award for Most Improved to Andrew Schutt, who spent hours on the green chipping and putting outside practice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spending almost as much time on the green in contests with Schutt was Kevin Lick, who was named Most Valuable Player. Lick qualified for the State golf tournament this year for the third year in a row.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAssistant Coach Gary Rohde presented the award for Most Improved girl golfer to Megan Downing, who won the same award in 2003. Downing will be the veteran golfer next spring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most Valuable Player was awarded to Jensie Hernandez, who qualified for the State tournament this spring.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Awards for Inspirational and Most Valuable Player in varsity tennis were voted on by the tennis team and awarded to Johnny Plesha. Plesha ended his season with a record of 28-2, according to tennis Coach Troy Whittle. His brother Danny Plesha received the award for Most Valuable Player in 2003. The duo took fourth place in State doubles tennis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In girls tennis, Lizeth Chiprez was presented the Inspirational Award. The girls team was very coachable and competitive this year, said Whittle. They finished fourth in league.

        "text":"2005 will bring many changes for Alderwood's parks department\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/11/2004\r\n\r\nAlderwood Parks and Recreation Director Don Stiles made what will almost certainly be his last budget presentation to the Alderwood City Council during its study session on Wednesday night.\r\n\r\nAs part of cuts in the 2005 budget to help make-up for a $393,910 shortfall, City Manager Tom Rockford proposed to Council to eliminate Stiles' position. The position cut will result in a $25,000 savings for the city.\r\n\r\nBut Stiles found an ally during Wednesday night's study session in Councilman Raul Martinez. Martinez said he would like to comb through the budget to find the $25,000 to keep Stiles, saying the position was important to the parks department.\r\n\r\n\"If we can find the funds as we comb through the budget, I would opt to keep a director,\" said Martinez.\r\n\r\nPrior to discussing Stiles' position, Council sifted through the 2005 budget requests for the parks department. An added expense in 2005 is the unforeseen duty to operate the community center next year.\r\n\r\nThe city will take back control of the community center because the Washington State Migrant Council, which is currently managing the facility, terminated its contract. The city assumes control of the community center Dec. 1. Plans are to locate the parks and recreation department at the community center, said Rockford.\r\n\r\nWhy the city is in such a quandary with the community center, said Rockford, is that under the terms of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) the city obtained for construction of the community center, officials have to keep the building open to the public.\r\n\r\n\"The difficulty we face here is having this thrust upon us when we really don't have the ability to say no,\" said Rockford.\r\n\r\nThe proposed 2005 budget for the parks department totals $530,270. Operating the community center will add an additional $63,180 in expenses. Rockford and Finance Director Chad Stotz estimate it will cost the city $73,180 to operate the community center in 2005, but the figure was reduced because the city is using $10,000 it already has available in the budget to operate the facility. The city is anticipating $53,400 in revenue from the community center in 2005.\r\n\r\nParks and rec salaries in 2005 will total $267,160, down from $272,630 in 2004. Under the proposed budget, Stiles will lose his position as parks director. This will result in the creation of a parks and recreation coordinator. The city will then hire a recreation assistant.\r\n\r\nRockford said it was a difficult decision to cut the parks and recreation director position.\r\n\r\nFocusing on the community center, Stiles explained that to maintain the staffing the Migrant Council has had at the community center, it will cost the city $25,560. Stiles said the city could help fund some of those positions by continuing catering services at the center. Stiles is speculating the city could raise $12,000 next year in catering.\r\n\r\nCouncilman John Torch wanted to look at partnering with the school district to possibly hire someone to oversee the community center and the operation of other venues in the community.\r\n\r\n\"I feel like all we are going to do at best is keep the doors open at the community center,\" said Torch.\r\n\r\nTorch said the problem with the city proposal is that the parks and recreation staff will be busy doing their duties and have no time to operate the center.\r\n\r\nRockford said one area the Migrant Council was successful in was obtaining volunteers at the community center. Rockford is hoping to establish a strong volunteer base. Rockford acknowledged that the next year will be a learning experience for operating the community center.\r\n\r\nMayor Rex Luthor wanted to continue to look at partnerships, but suggested Council move forward with adopting the proposed budget.\r\n\r\nMuch like Martinez, Torch was cautious about having the position of recreation coordinator be in charge of parks and recreation duties. Torch said he would like to look through the parks budget for extra revenue funds.\r\n\r\nStiles ended the evening with a few comments for Council. Stiles said he doesn't agree 100 percent with the decision by Rockford to eliminate his position. Stiles nixed a suggestion that he serves as director of the community center. If Council does decide to eliminate his position, Stiles told Council that after 17 plus years working as parks director it would be hard for him to relinquish the role.\r\n\r\n\"It is going to be a challenge, but there are some things I am looking at,\" said Stiles. \"I appreciate the opportunity to have worked for the City of Alderwood.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two other areas that fall within the parks and recreation budget-the Alderwood Museum and the Alderwood Senior Center. These two items are reviewed as separate budget areas.\r\n\r\nThe city was able to free up some extra money after relinquishing control of the library to the Yakima Regional Library System.\r\n\r\nMaintenance and custodial work for the local library fell under control of the Alderwood parks department.\r\n\r\nAs a result of giving up operation of the library, Rockford in the 2005 preliminary budget spread around the duties of the custodian that cleaned the library. This results in a little less than $4,000 salary increase for the custodian cleaning the museum.\r\n\r\nThe budget for the Alderwood Senior Center, which is also a separate item from the actual parks and recreation budget, will see a minimal increase in its 2005 budget because of additional custodial work. The proposed budget for the senior center in 2005 is $15,600, up from $12,810 in 2004.\r\n"

Jones said he felt that was an unfair amount the district had to pay, considering the city has open access to all district facilities.\r\n\r\nMayor Rex Luthor couldn't agree more with the suggestions of Bones at Thursday night's meeting. Luthor wanted to even include the district being able to utilize SunnyView Park.\r\n\"I think we should have everything in there,\" said Luthor.\r\nThe two sides are scheduled to sit down and iron out the details of the interlocal agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Mayor Rex Luthor reminded Council that 1 percent of all sales tax revenue goes back into city coffers.\r\n\u00a0"

        "text":"Grizzlies maul the Wolves in Homecoming game\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/18/2004\r\n\r\nA fumble prone second half was about the only drawback for the Alderwood High School football team in this past Friday night's Homecoming game against Wapato.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two-headed monster of Greg Gilleland and Joe Schwartz did most of the damage for the Grizzlies, as they helped record a commanding 42-21 victory over the Wolfpack.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I thought we played well,\" said Alderwood Coach Mark Marro, \"but we didn't hold onto the ball.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood got on the board early in the game when Gilleland returned an interception 40 yards for a touchdown. The Grizzlies' other early score came in the first quarter when Gilleland popped off a 20-yard touchdown run.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fun for Grizzly fans didn't stop with the end of the first quarter, as Alderwood scored twice in the second period. Gilleland scored both second quarter touchdowns, one off a one-yard run and the other a 22-yard pass from quarterback Tony Cantu.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Wolfpack was able to sustain a drive in the second quarter that led to a touchdown, when Wapato quarterback Jason Pitt found receiver Mark McDaniel on a five-yard pass.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second half was sort of a different story for the Grizzlies, as they didn't look \r\n\r\nanything like they did in the opening two quarters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second half saw the Grizzlies fumble three times inside the Wolfpack's 20-yard line.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We can't afford to cough up the ball,\" said Marro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wapato took advantage of the slippery hands of the Grizzlies in the second half.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Wolfpack drove nearly the length of the field in the third quarter to see the drive end on a one-yard touchdown run from Art Weaver.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the score 28-14, the Grizzlies got back to pounding the ball on the ground. Gilleland scored on a four-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Teammate Joe Schwartz added a 17-yard touchdown run to account for the final score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wapato's Justin Clements gave the Wolfpack its last score when he ran past the Grizzly defense on a 74-yard touchdown run.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Grizzlies did a nice job of keeping Wapato's defense guessing. \r\n\r\nAlderwood was able to mix in an effective passing game with a dominating run attack. Cantu went 10-for-16 on the night through the air for 186 yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We wanted Tony to throw the ball,\" said Marro. \"We are going to need him to throw the ball in the next couple of weeks.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro said he was impressed with the way Wapato played, as the Wolfpack was putting some hard hits on the Grizzlies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They have steadily gotten better,\" said Marro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro was also impressed with the play of his offensive line, which opened holes for Gilleland and Schwartz all night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gilleland ended up rushing for 158 yards on 24 carries while Schwartz had 101 yards off 14 totes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nGilleland also had two receptions for 67 yards. Gilleland set a new school record for most points scored in a game. Gilleland scored 30 points on Friday night, breaking Larry Coleman's record set in 1979 of 26 points against East Valley-Spokane. Gilleland also tied the record with a host of other players for most rushing touchdowns in a game with three.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One Alderwood player who performed extremely well Friday night was Noe Zamarron, who was both a force on the offensive and defensive sides of the ball. Zamarron had three catches for 52 yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He has great hands,\" said Marro. \"Noe is an exceptional athlete.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only drawback in the game that Marro saw was the fumbles by Alderwood in the second half. Marro also felt his defensive unit could have done a better job of tackling in the second half.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We missed a lot of tackles,\" said Marro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides the fumbles, Marro felt his team did an exceptional job of playing the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We got pretty much what we expected from the players,\" said Marro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood (2-2, 4-3) will be without the services of Gilleland for a crucial Mid-Valley League match-up at Ellensburg. Gilleland was ejected late from Friday's game for an altercation with a Wapato player.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is always a tough place to play at Ellensburg,\" said Marro. \"I am excited about the game.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro said the game against Ellensburg is a must win if Alderwood wants to stay in playoff contention.\u00a0\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Murray retains U.S. Senate seat\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/3/2004\r\n\r\nWashington voters must still like the message of the lady who made a name for herself wearing tennis shoes and being a working mom.\r\nPatty Murray, a Democrat, was overwhelming re-elected to a six-year U.S. Senate term last night, as she defeated Republican challenger George Nethercutt.\r\nElection results this morning had Murray with 53.9 percent of all ballots cast (1,020,470 votes), compared with Nethercutt, who had 832,527 votes (44 percent).\r\nMurray basically took the election with her win in King County, where she had 344,702 votes compared with Nethercutt's 174,495 votes. Murray also won big in Snohomish County, beating Nethercutt by a little less than 26,000 votes. Murray won Thurston County by nearly 14,000 votes.\r\n\r\nNethercutt was a winner in Alderwood County (26,236 votes). Murray garnered 21,204 votes in Alderwood County. Nethercutt also won huge in his native Spokane County with 94,930 votes compared with Murray's 61,998.\r\n\r\nHastings vs. Matheson\r\nFourth District Congressman Doc Hastings fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from political newcomer Sandy Matheson, a Democrat. In this morning's tallies, Hastings had 62.6 percent of all ballots cast (110,579 votes), compared with Matheson's 65,998 votes (37.7 percent).\r\nHastings won Alderwood County with 27,623 votes. Matheson had 20,520 votes. Hastings, a Tri-Cities native, also won heavily in Benton County, taking 29,415 votes. Matheson had just over 17,000 votes in Benton County. Hastings didn't lose one of the 10 counties in his district.\r\n\r\n\"It's my privilege to serve as Central Washington's voice in Congress and I'm honored that the people have chosen me to represent them for another two years,\" said Hastings. \"I plan to build upon my record of service to families and communities so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy a happy, healthy and prosperous future right here in Central Washington.\"\r\n\r\nGregoire vs. Rossi\r\nIt looks as if the race for Washington state governor between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi will go down to the wire. This morning's vote totals had the two running neck and neck, with Gregoire holding a slight edge. Gregoire had 908,077 votes (48.96 percent). Rossi so far has 907,691 votes (48.94 percent).\r\nRossi has so far won 30 of the 39 counties in Washington state. But Gregoire is well ahead in the crucial King County counts with 305,281 votes compared to Rossi's 211,266 votes. Rossi easily defeated Gregoire in Alderwood County with 30,592 votes to her 16,892 votes. Rossi also won huge in Benton County with 32,118 votes to Gregoire's 14,258 votes.\r\n\r\nDistrict 15\r\nIn other election results, Bruce Chandler was re-elected to his 15th legislative district seat. He ran unopposed. Dan Newhouse was a big winner in Alderwood County over Democratic challenger Michael Kepcha. The 15th District representative tallied 8,866 votes in the county, compared to Kepcha's 4,023 votes.\r\n\r\nCounty commission\r\nMike Leita is the newest Alderwood County commissioner. The Republican took nearly 70 percent of the votes in his bid for the district No. 1 seat. Leita replaces long-time Commissioner Tim June, who decided not to seek re-election. Alderwood County Commissioner Tom Camay won his re-election bid, as he is more than 6,000 votes ahead of his nearest challenger, Yakima Mayor Paul George.\r\n\r\nIn other state election news, voters re-elected Lt. Governor Brad Owen and Secretary of State Sam Reed. Mike Murphy won his bid for state treasurer. Brian Sonntag will continue as state auditor. It looks as if Rob McKenna will be the new state attorney general.\r\n\r\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Terry Bergeson won her re-election bid, easily defeating Judith Billings, who was looking to reclaim the position she once held.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Working Stiff\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/5/2004\r\n\r\nFor more than 20 years Linda Roberson has been providing electrolysis services to Lower Valley residents seeking permanent hair removal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most of her career, Roberson has practiced out of a beauty shop on Seventh Street in Alderwood, but about four years ago when New Image moved to Edison Avenue, so did Roberson.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roberson and her sister, who lives in Yakima, are both certified electrologists.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In our family we have people who have a lot of hair and you can't work on yourself, so when the opportunity came up we both took the classes,\" said the Mabton resident.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"It's a rewarding field,\" said Roberson, who finds a lot of satisfaction in helping women who are uncomfortable with facial hair or other problem areas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are three times in life when women grow hair, puberty, pregnancy and menopause,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Roberson's services are not only sought by women. Men wanting their hands or backs hairless also visit her, as do high school aged boys and girls and college students home on vacation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As of today, electrolysis is the only method of permanent hair removal that is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration,\" said Roberson. She said plucking, tweezing, creams, waxes and other methods of hair removal don't kill the follicle and instead draw more blood to the area where hair is removed, causing it to grow back thicker and darker.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although some people think that electrolysis is similar to a medical procedure, Roberson is quick to let all know that they are not medical persons, but she added it is not the \"back door business\" people used to think it was.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We are not medical people ourselves, but we have a lot of medical people talk to us,\" said Roberson.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She recently returned from an electrolysis conference in Las Vegas, where she heard from medical professionals on different things to look for on client's skin and was updated on new technologies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roberson said she often sees or notices changes in moles that a client may not know about.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWithout diagnosing a skin problem, she may suggest that a client see their doctor about the condition. On a few occasions Roberson's suggestion to go to the doctor has proven to benefit her clients, who were found to have cancerous spots on their faces.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Electrolysis by Linda is a second job for Roberson, who does quality control for Stadelman Fruit Company in Zillah. Her Alderwood office hours are in the late afternoon and evening by appointment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I give a free consultation to anyone interested,\" said Roberson. \"This is not like getting a shot,\" she tells her clients. \"I go along the hair follicle and use a high frequency heat machine to cook the hair from the inside out.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roberson said her clients keep her interested in continuing electrolysis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When I see my clients on the street walking with their head high, it makes me feel good,\" said Roberson.\r\n"

But of the 24 students who took the ACT this past year, the average score was 20.8 on the test, she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The national average is 20.9. However, the Alderwood students' average was slightly below the state average of 22.5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Washington was ranked among the top three states in the nation for outstanding performance on the ACT. Only Vermont and Maine ranked higher than Washington, said Dr. Terry Bergeson, the state superintendent of public instruction.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bergeson said the state's results from the ACT is a strong indication that the work being done in Washington schools is better preparing students for life after college.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm particularly pleased to see that, as more of our diverse students participate in this test, our scores remain high. This is truly a success story we can be proud of in our state,\" Bergeson said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ACT is one of two widely recognized exams used to gauge readiness for college. While not a required state assessment tool, the ACT, like the SAT, measures a student's readiness for college in English, reading, math and science. Scores are given on a scale of 1 to 36 with 36 being the best possible score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Our students earned scores from 13 to 29,\" said Kilian.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mirroring the national increase in participation, more Washington graduates are choosing to take the ACT.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We are seeing more of our students taking the ACT,\" Kilian said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, the SAT remains the most popular of the college readiness exams taken by Alderwood students, she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It (the SAT) is just the test most students are more familiar with as a pre-college exam requirement,\" she explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.

Bottomley oversees a district which covers the central part of British Columbia from Clearwater to Alderwood in Central Washington.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bottomley, who has been a member of Rotary International since 1969, praised the Noon Club's 27 members for their support of such charitable projects as the International Rotarian's polio eradication program, Roto-plast, Rotary International Foundation, as well as the youth exchange program, which is a large part of the international relationships fostered by the network of businessmen and company executives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bottomley encouraged the Alderwood Rotarians to continue to do good work and to continue to add to its membership.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bottomley said Rotary International is preparing to celebrate 100 years of service this year and continues to be dedicated to programs involving eradication of illiteracy, unsafe water, diseases and hunger in developing countries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Most of us live comfortably in safe and clean environments,\" he noted. \"We can celebrate our situation by continuing to help those who need our help,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I want to thank you (Alderwood Noon Club members) for your continued support of international projects, but also for your continued efforts centered on local projects, such as the swim team, your Christmas giving and scholarships to area students,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm proud to serve this district which takes as its motto - \"we are dependable, reliable and available,\" he added.\r\n"

        "text":"Alderwood Police Department support staff gets new contract\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/16/2004\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood City Council approved its final in a series of recent collective bargaining agreements.\r\n\r\nThe Council approved a new three-year agreement with the support staff of the Alderwood Police Department. Support staff at the police department includes dispatchers, jailers and corrections officers.\r\n\r\n\"We have been negotiating some time on this,\" said Interim City Manager Bruce Rinz.\r\nCouncilman Alex de la Cruz excused himself from voting on the matter because of his involvement with the police department's reserve program.\r\nRinz added the approved three-year agreement is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2003.\r\n\r\nOne of the areas the city has been looking at, which is addressed in the new agreement, is cross training staff. Rinz used as an example that the cross training would involve dispatchers being able to the job of a corrections officer. Rinz said there are \"tons\" of benefits to the city in being able to cross train employees to perform multiple tasks.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the contract, police support staff will receive a 5 percent retroactive pay increase dating back to the beginning of last year. Support staff will receive an additional 3 percent pay increase for this year, which will conclude with a 5 percent pay increase in 2005.\r\n\r\nRinz said the city is not quite ready to begin cross training employees. Once the program is in place, employees will be given a 7 percent pay increase.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of the agreement includes employees being compensated for unused sick leave. Under the contract, employees may incur and roll over up to 960 hours of sick leave. Employees will be paid 25 percent of their current salary for any unused sick leave in excess of 960 hours. Employees in this department are also eligible for vacation buy back.\r\n\r\nThe contract also points out that sometimes dispatchers, data entry clerks and receptionists will be required to search prisoners when no other staff is available. Training will be provided to these employees. The employees will receive an extra $1 for each individual prisoner they search.\r\n\r\nThere is also an education incentive for members of the bargaining unit if pursuing an Associate of Arts, science or applied science degree. Councilman John Torch asked Police Chief Ted Mana if anyone was taking advantage of the education incentive program, which allows for a 1.5 percent pay increase for every 45 college quarter credits earned. The incentive pay will not exceed 3 percent of the base pay. Mana said there are only two of the 14 support staff members taking advantage of the education incentive program.\r\n\r\nAlso under the terms of the contract, the city will contribute up to $761 per month towards health insurance plans in 2004. Beginning Jan. 1, 2005, the figure will increase to $811 per month per employee for health insurance.\r\n\r\nThe agreement between the police department support staff and the city will expire Dec. 31, 2005.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Pioneers end G'view's season\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/8/2004\r\n\r\nOMAK - Omak's power-I offense proved to be too much to overcome for the Grandview High School football team last Friday night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Pioneers claimed a 28-12 opening round District win over Grandview to earn the right to move on to the State playoffs. The Greyhounds (3-3, 3-6) saw their season come to a close.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grandview was poised several times to take the early lead on the Pioneers' home field, but three first quarter stops by Omak after the 'Hounds had driven the ball deep into Pioneer territory thwarted any such hopes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First year Grandview Coach Dustin Lamb said his club had three red zone scoring opportunities in the opening period. \"But on two of them we had dropped passes in crucial situations, and with the other we had a penalty that backed us up.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOmak also snuffed a couple of other Grandview drives in the first half when the Pioneers came up with a pair of interceptions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 'Hounds were forced into playing catch-up football after Omak posted three touchdowns in the second quarter. Two of the TD's came on passes, from Pioneer QB Cody Campbell to Brenden Kaermingk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They had us down 21-0 at the half,\" said Lamb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither club could muster much of anything in the third quarter. But in the final period of play, Grandview made a run at the Pioneers. The Greyhounds finally got on the scoreboard when their quarterback, Brandon Artz, hit running back Silas Hansen with a 24-yard scoring strike. Artz followed up the TD with another touchdown toss to James Vela, the second one a 22-yarder. The Artz to Vela hook-up cut Omak's lead to 21-12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Pioneers didn't allow Grandview to get any closer, though. Omak put an insurance touchdown on the scoreboard to account for the final 28-12 score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Greyhounds put up some decent numbers on offense, despite being limited to two touchdowns on the night. Rushing-wise, Grandview tallied 88 yards. Hansen got most of the yardage, gaining 63 yards on 17 carries. Frank Medina toted the ball six times and picked up 17 yards for Grandview, with James Vela totaling eight yards on three carries. \r\n\r\nThrough the air, Artz was 19-for-35 for 176 yards. Vela grabbed 10 of Artz's passes and picked up 93 yards on the receptions. Hansen had three catches for 54 yards, with Kevin Concienne gaining 25 yards on four receptions and Medina hauling in two passes for four yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Pioneers tallied just over 350 total yards on the offensive side of the ball.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In assessing his first year as coach of the 'Hounds, Lamb said he is pleased with how Grandview fared this season.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were in every game, with the exception of the East Valley and Othello contests,\" Lamb said. \"For our seniors, it was their second straight appearance in the District playoffs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I compliment our seniors for a good season, especially with having to learn new stuff this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And, we played a lot of younger kids this season. By no means is our cubboard bare,\" he added.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"State WASL achievement gaps narrow, local schools make significant gains\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/3/2004\r\n\r\n\"We are beginning to achieve momentum\" said new Mabton School District Superintendent Sandra Pasiero-Davis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her comments echo the praise given by the leader of Washington state education, Dr. Terry Bergeson, who on Wednesday proclaimed major increases in the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) scores given to fourth, seventh and 10th graders.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bergeson singled out a number of school districts, including Mabton, that have made notable gains in their WASL scores.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Washington's fourth, seventh and 10th grade students reached higher levels of achievement on the WASL than they ever have before,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nScores in math, reading, writing and science rose in every grade across the state, Bergeson said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In addition, outstanding gains were made in many of the districts that were struggling to achieve academic success,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among those were schools in the Granger, Yakima, Selah, Mount Adams, and Toppenish school districts Bergeson said. Each of these districts made outstanding gains in math and reading on all levels.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"All of these gains can be attributed to the hard work of Washington's wonderful teachers in partnership with support staff, administration, parents community and business leaders and, of course, the students,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mabton School District is one of five schools in Yakima County to show outstanding improvements in state test scores, agreed Dr. Jane Gutting, Superintendent of Educational Service District (ESD) 105.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Significant gains have been made at all of our schools in the ESD,\" Gutting said. \"There are many such success stories,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We're very excited that our district's students' test scores are increasing,\" Pasiero-Davis said. \"Even the students are excited about their achievements.\" .\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mabton Junior High students showed 21 percent increases in reading, 20 percent in writing and 12 percent gains in math, while Mabton High School students made 21 percent gains in writing and 14 percent gains in math, said Keith Morris, who is principal for both the schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile in Alderwood, Washington Elementary School's use of the Reading First program is credited with helping to achieve double digit gains in that building's reading scores, said Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Washington Elementary students showed a 27.6 percent increase in reading, as well as a 17 percent increase in writing and a whooping 44 percent gain in math,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones said Alderwood schools all made gains in WASL reading achievements. \"We very proud of all of our schools for the significant gains being made,\" said Bones.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Washington did an outstanding job of boosting its achievement scores,\" said Bones.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlderwood's results from the 2003-04 WASL were its best over the past five years, Bones explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Our fourth grade WASL reading scores have shown an upward trend and steady growth for the past eight years,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, four of the six Alderwood district schools also made significant gains in math, ranging from 0.6 percent to 44.2 percent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Five of our schools also made upward of 16.6 percent gains in writing,\" he added\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones said Pioneer Elementary School had its highest gains ever with a 20.2 percent gain in reading and a 12.1 percent gain in math scores. Outlook Elementary School made a 3.9 percent gain in reading.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Harrison Middle School seventh graders showed a 4.9 percent gain in reading scores while Alderwood High School 10th graders showed a 5.9 percent gain. PRIDE High School students turned in a 4.4 percent gain in WASL reading scores.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Math scores also showed gains at the elementary schools and at the middle school.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nCredit for many of the gains made by the districts is the result of the implementation of research-based curriculum changes. For example, in Mabton, improvements were made by adopting school-wide improvement programs and a dramatic change in teaching practices, explained school officials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We have hit upon the formula for success,\" Pasiero-Davis said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We are seeing steady gains year after year and that is the most powerful way to achieve momentum,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morris credits the gains to the willingness of the Mabton education staff to share teaching practices and to adopt change as needed. He also credits the students with taking a more active role in their education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We are focused on quality instruction in every classroom with high expectations for all students,\" Morris said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morris' comments were echoed by Bones, who said Alderwood teachers' efforts are similarly based on research-based curriculum changes. \"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The good news is we are seeing benchmark growth from fall to spring,\" Bones said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"\"It's clear that our decade-long efforts to improve Washington schools are working,\" agreed Bergeson.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We know now how to improve students' reading comprehension, writing and mathematics skills. The primary challenge now is to commit the resources to spread these strategies across the state so that every school and district can benefit from them,\" Bergeson said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/16/2004\r\n\r\nVote yes for local bond/levy issues\r\nIt is our pleasure to endorse the Alderwood School District special levy/bond issues. We know that the passage of these issues will make a tremendous difference in the education of all of our students. We have seen the positive results of the previous special levy. The purchase of curriculum materials and supplies, safety officers and technology enhancements alone have been a wonderful assistance to our students and staff.\r\nWe ask for your consideration and yes vote on the 2004 bond and special levy. Taxes will increase 20\u00a2 ($1.41 to $1.61 per $1,000 of home valuation). The district will receive $3,744,357 annually for four years. Also, $40 million in new construction and modernization projects will occur.\r\nAlderwood School District voters' approval of these issues will support students and building projects for years and years to come. We need your help!\r\nPlease vote yes\u0097bond and levy\u0097Feb. 3.\r\n/s/ Barbara Quigley and Heidi Roedel, Outlook\r\n\u00a0\r\nVote yes\r\nBe sure to vote yes on the Alderwood School District levy and bond.\r\nBy doing so we improve our district. With the yes on the levy we get matching state funds and this will help with classes and materials.\r\nThe bond gives us more and better schools, as we are growing and need the space. A good working area creates a better atmosphere for our kids to learn in.\r\nAlderwood School District has not deceived us on funding before, and is now helping to make the district even better for only a few cents per thousand (of assessed valuation).\r\nAs a past school director I have kept an eye on what happens in the district and feel very comfortable saying, \"Vote yes on the levy and bond. It really is the cheapest way to improve our district.\"\r\n/s/ Gene McIntire, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nBeef rally\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all the individuals who attended the rally in Mabton on Saturday, Jan. 10. The outpouring of support given to the cattle industry and the community during this difficult time was greatly appreciated.\r\nWe would especially like to thank Clear Channel Broadcasting for its efforts in coordinating this community service event, which brought more than 2,600 visitors to our small community. With the cooperation of the school district, various law enforcement agencies, city staff and the overwhelming positive attitude of the participants, this was a very successful event.\r\nA special thank you to all our local, state and federal representatives and members of the Cattleman's Association who braved the weather to attend and support this rally. We also want to acknowledge the following participants: Van de Graaf family, Kallenberger family, Lommers family, Ray's Meats, Jerry's Valley Meats, Coca Cola Co. and M&M Catering for donating their time and products.\r\n/s/ Mabton Mayor David Conradt\r\n\u00a0\r\nBlood drawing\r\nThe Ladies Society of the Calvary Lutheran Church sponsored a very successful blood drawing on Tuesday, Jan. 6. Karon Kilian was the chairperson.\r\nThe snow was falling all day and it was very cold. But that didn't stop the people from coming in to donate the much needed blood. We had 66 presenters and two first-time donors. Three were unable to give, leaving 63 units collected. Because of their generosity, 126 people will have another chance at life. Without you this drawing would not be possible.\r\nA special thanks to the sponsors for the delicious cookies and juice, the United Methodist Church for the use of its hall, Max of Washington Corrugators for putting out the signs and the Alderwood Daily News for the wonderful publicity.\r\nMany thanks to the following volunteers: Myrtis Lang, Ella Mae Lochner, Alice Benedetti, Phyllis Morris, Marilyn Vessey, Sharon Slaight, Chris Reihs and Maxine Means.\r\nHope to see you at the next blood drawing on Tuesday, March 2, at the United Methodist Church, from 2 to 6 p.m.\r\n/s/ Marie Handy, Alderwood blood drawing chairman\r\n"

In 1918 her parents moved to Alderwood, and later to the Emerald District south of town, where she received her education at Wendell Phillips schoolhouse.

She loved to cook and feed anyone stepping across her threshold. She spent time going to garage sales and bartering for good deals.

Grandview defeated both teams in three, winning over Ephrata by scores of 25-18, 25-13, 25-15 and beating Ki-Be by scores of 28-26, 25-19, 25-18.\r\n\r\n\"They played well,\" Grandview Coach John LaFever said of his team. \"Everyone was pretty excited.\"\r\nLaFever noted that the Lady 'Hounds put forth a good team effort Saturday.\r\n\"All of the players did all of their parts well,\" he said. \"It was a good District championship.\"\r\nLaFever said going into the tournament he knew Ephrata was going to be a tough team to beat, only because they were playing on their home court.\r\n\"That's a little bit of an advantage,\" he noted.\r\nHowever, it was an advantage that ended up not working out for Ephrata, with Grandview powering past them.\r\n\r\nHelping the Lady 'Hounds win over Ephrata and Ki-Be were a number of Grandview players, including senior Danelle Cowan who finished the day with 36 kills, 34 digs, 9 blocks and 2 service aces. Senior Valentina Solis finished with 18 kills, 9 blocks, 4 aces and 21 service points, senior Mari Cornejo had 4 kills and 6 blocks, Chante Bottineau had 3 kills, 57 assists and 18 digs, Kealey Johnston had 8 kills, 47 digs, 3 aces and 17 service points, Angie Cabrera had 2 kills, 37 digs and 3 aces, and Tonhya Wysong had 63 digs.\r\n\r\nLaFever said he can't remember a time when the Grandview team went this far into the postseason with no game losses. He noted that even in 2000, when his team placed second at State, they lost their first game of the District tournament.\r\n\"So they're doing ok,\" LaFever said of this year's team.\r\nThe Lady 'Hounds will take to the court for the State tournament Friday, where they will face off against the team from Steilacoom. The State tournament will be held at the Yakima SunDome.\r\n"

        "text":"Grads bid farewell to Alderwood High School\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 6/7/2004\r\n\r\nLeading 275 students onto the field of Clem Senn Field, 80-year-old Roy Culver was the oldest graduate to receive his diploma at the Alderwood High School commencement exercise last Friday night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culver graduated as part of the Operation Recognition program, which allows military veterans who left school early to join World War II ranks to receive high school diplomas. As a part of the ceremony Culver not only received his diploma, but a long-awaited standing ovation from the crowd.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culver's recognition set the tone of the event, at which both Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones and class speaker, American History and CWP teacher Monty Johnson, encouraged the young graduates to be part of their communities and vote.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones also encouraged the graduates to, no later than Saturday, sit down and think about what their goals are and to raise them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's important to set your goals high because you can do it,\" said Bones. \"You are successful. Don't be afraid to fail or challenge your future.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson addressed the class saying, \"You're the sons and daughters of this community. Take pride in yourselves. We have invested in you and we have invested well.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said there is much that faces the graduates as they leave Alderwood and enter the world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson said as Alderwood thrives and grows local residents will try to better it with our own interests in mind, to draw back some of the recent graduates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He encouraged the youths to become a part of their community, whether it be Alderwood or another town. He encouraged the youths to find a community and become a volunteer, join a service club or help a friend in need.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't consider your education complete,\" he said, encouraging the young adults to be constant learners, informing themselves about what is going on in the world around them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He also encouraged the youths to participate in the country's democracy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Many of you are 18, or soon will be. I encourage you to vote this fall,\" said Johnson.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He added that to vote and not know what you're voting for is worse than not voting at all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know the world holds a lot for you,\" said Johnson. \"So be informed, participate in the process and never ever sell yourselves short.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also speaking at the graduation were salutatorian Amy Kilian and co-valedictorians Stacey Gorski and Joshua Barr.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kilian said as an eighth grader she was sick a lot and her grades began to slip. In danger of getting a C, she went to her teacher to beg for a better grade.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In her mind, Kilian said, the sky turned black, the teacher sprouted devil horns and bellowed down on her NO!, when in fact that was all in her mind.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reality, Kilian said, when she was in eighth grade she was able to get a B in the class she was afraid she would get a C in and it was the last B she ever got. Kilian said memories are just fact-perception and image.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Scientists have proven that you choose how you remember things,\" said Kilian.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kilian said she will always remember the funny moments with her classmates, including the slow-motion portions of the drama club's presentation of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said if her fellow classmates' memories include Miss Schuette sending them home because their shorts had a 2\" inseam, they probably shouldn't wear those shorts to a job interview.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She encouraged her classmates as they leave Alderwood High School to spice up their lives, just like they spice up their memories.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barr said that it was eight years before that he decided to be valedictorian. He said it was because of friends, teachers and family that he was able to make it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"For better or for worse they form the core of who you are,\" said Barr.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a middle school student, Barr remembers the day his father asked him if he wanted to go to the library.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, it wasn't the library downtown, but it was the one in Richland,\" said Barr, explaining that his father took four hours out of his life just to take him to the library.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"The little things can mean so much,\" said Barr, who is always reading, which he said has been instrumental in his academic success.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barr said as a youngster he didn't want to learn to read, but his mother got him interested, which changed his life.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a second grader, Barr remembers being punished for reading ahead, which almost squelched his interest in education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Teachers,\" he said, \"Your job is not just to guide your students though a series of lessons. Don't worry about what they'll learn next year, there are always things to learn.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Barr said that through his life, God has been his strength.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He has been my shield, my rock and my saviour,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gorski, an award-winning science fair contest participant, examined the class of 2004 as if it were a science fair project.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said the class of 2004 science fair project would be called \"Driven, Determined and Dedicated.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said her classmates have not only shown these qualities in their success, but also in their friendships to each other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hypotheses of the project, she said, is \"We, the class of 2004, can conquer and do anything with hard work, diligence and creativity.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The goal of the project is to use creativity, put in all you have, be diligent and successful, Gorski said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said the class has plenty of evidence to support the goals for their projects with pictures of family and friends, state games and meets traveled to, some of which were won and some lost, drama productions, homecoming and Senior Follies, which raised $2,100.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said the conclusion would read that the class of 2004 can conquer anything because they are driven, determined and dedicated.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" she said, \"It's scientifically proven that you will succeed.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gorski was later presented the Outstanding Senior Girl award. Tanner Kellogg was named Outstanding Senior Boy. Outstanding Senior Boy Athlete was awarded to R.J. Elizondo and Isley Gonzalez was presented Outstanding Senior Girl Athlete.\r\n"

        "text":"Obituaries\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/29/2004\r\n\r\nEUGENE PATRICK CHARVET JR.\r\nEugene Patrick Charvet Jr., 75, of Grandview went to be with his Lord and Savior Thursday, March 25, 2004, from Yakima Regional Hospital.\r\nEugene was born Jan. 5, 1929 at the family home, the son of Edna May (Carlson) and Eugene Patrick Charvet. Eugene received his grade school education from Sacred Heart School in Seattle, middle school from Brisco School in Kent, and secondary school from O\u0092Day High School in Seattle, receiving a degree in theology and music from St. Martin\u0092s College in Olympia/Lacey, in three years. Eugene served for two years in the U.S. Army, receiving his basic training at Fort Ord, Calif., then was stationed and served at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Eugene spent seven years at the Trappist Monastery Guadalupe at Lafayette, Ore. He was sent home by the Abbot of the Trappist to care for his parents and brother, Tommy. He took his assignment to heart and cared for his family very well and faithfully.\r\nEugene became a strong part of the Fabric of the Blessed Sacrament Parish of Grandview, a part of the establishment To Say! He attended daily Mass, taught CCD, baptish, confirmation and marriage preparation classes, along with helping with daily Mass. Eugene was like a sacristan, performing many duties at different times, like typing the church bulletin, playing organ, and piano, directing and singing in the choir. He was on the Bishops Religious Education Council and was selected to be the representative from the Yakima Diocese to attend the religious convention in Philadelphia in 1972.\r\nEugene was a member of the Knights of Columbus and went through all the chairs, serving as Grand Knight and also served as financial secretary for many years. He was a life member of the Fourth Degree Honor Guard and Fourth Degree Knights of Columbus. He became a Eucharistic minister distributing communion, reading scriptures and giving faith and hope to the sick and shut-ins.\r\nHe played the piano for the residents in most of the nursing homes in the Lower Valley. On Sunday Eugene spent time ministering at the Alderwood County jail. Eugene was recognized at the Yakima Diocese Fifty-Year Celebration for his self-selected duties at the parish, jail, nursing homes, shut-ins and much more. Eugene was very helpful to all the priests that served at the Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, preparing for daily Mass and anything that was needed. Monsignor McDonnell was a very special friend to Eugene. Eugene also headed up the Legion of Mary. He made many rosaries, said the rosary and meditated over each one before it was given with love. He was deeply devoted to Mary and prayed the Rosary and the Divine Office daily.\r\nEugene was a bookkeeper for Top Side Canning Company and R. H. Jones. He farmed hops for a period of time and kept books for the family farm.\r\nEugene loved sharing his time and talent of music with the sick and those in need. No one, but the Lord, will know how many lives Eugene touched in so many ways.\r\nEugene is survived by one sister, Alice Waddle of Grandview; two brothers, Martin (Frank) Charvet of Grandview and Ernest Charvet and wife, Laura, of Mabton; one special aunt, Alice Carlson of Grandview; one brother-in-law, Tom Healy of Seattle; one sister-in-law, Anna May Charvet of Mabton; 27 nieces and nephews; and numerous great nieces and nephews.\r\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; one sister, Josie Healy; three brothers, Richard and wife, Rosella, Tommy and Jerry; one sister-in-law, Donna Charvet; one brother-in-law, George Waddle; and five nephews.\r\nViewing and visitation will be held Monday, March 29, 2004, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at Jones Funeral Home, Grandview.

        "text":"Ricin FactSheet\r\n\r\nWhat ricin is\r\n\u0095\tRicin is a poison that can be made from the waste left over from processing castor beans. \r\n\u0095\tIt can be in the form of a powder, a mist, or a pellet, or it can be dissolved in water or weak acid. \r\n\u0095\tIt is a stable substance. For example, it is not affected much by extreme conditions such as very hot or very cold temperatures. \r\n\r\nWhere ricin is found and how it is used\r\n\u0095\tCastor beans are processed throughout the world to make castor oil. Ricin is part of the waste \u0093mash\u0094 produced when castor oil is made. \r\n\u0095\tRicin has some potential medical uses, such as bone marrow transplants and cancer treatment (to kill cancer cells). \r\n\r\nHow you could be exposed to ricin\r\n\u0095\tIt would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. Accidental exposure to ricin is highly unlikely. \r\n\u0095\tPeople can breathe in ricin mist or powder and be poisoned. \r\n\u0095\tRicin can also get into water or food and then be swallowed. \r\n\u0095\tPellets of ricin, or ricin dissolved in a liquid, can be injected into people\u0092s bodies. \r\n\u0095\tDepending on the route of exposure (such as injection or inhalation), as little as 500 micrograms of ricin could be enough to kill an adult. A 500-microgram dose of ricin would be about the size of the head of a pin. A greater amount would likely be needed to kill people if the ricin were swallowed. \r\n\u0095\tIn 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov\u0092s skin. \r\n\u0095\tSome reports have indicated that ricin may have been used in the Iran-Iraq war during the 1980s and that quantities of ricin were found in Al Qaeda caves in Afghanistan. \r\n\u0095\tRicin poisoning is not contagious. It cannot be spread from person to person through casual contact. \r\n\r\nHow ricin works\r\n\u0095\tRicin works by getting inside the cells of a person\u0092s body and preventing the cells from making the proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. Eventually this is harmful to the whole body, and death may occur. \r\n\u0095\tEffects of ricin poisoning depend on whether ricin was inhaled, ingested, or injected. \r\n\r\nSigns and symptoms of ricin exposure\r\n\u0095\tThe major symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received, though many organs may be affected in severe cases. \r\n\u0095\tInitial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours. \r\n\u0095\tInhalation: Within a few hours of inhaling significant amounts of ricin, the likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x-ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. In cases of known exposure to ricin, people having respiratory symptoms that started within 12 hours of inhaling ricin should seek medical care. \r\n\u0095\tIngestion: If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may become bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person\u0092s liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. \r\n\u0095\tSkin and eye exposure: Ricin in the powder or mist form can cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. \r\n\u0095\tDeath from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5 days, the victim usually recovers. \r\n\u0095\tShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to ricin. \r\n\r\nHow ricin poisoning is treated\r\nBecause no antidote exists for ricin, the most important factor is avoiding ricin exposure in the first place. If exposure cannot be avoided, the most important factor is then getting the ricin off or out of the body as quickly as possible. Ricin poisoning is treated by giving victims supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the poisoning. The types of supportive medical care would depend on several factors, such as the route by which victims were poisoned (that is, whether poisoning was by inhalation, ingestion, or skin or eye exposure). Care could include such measures as helping victims breathe, giving them intravenous fluids (fluids given through a needle inserted into a vein), giving them medications to treat conditions such as seizure and low blood pressure, flushing their stomachs with activated charcoal (if the ricin has been very recently ingested), or washing out their eyes with water if their eyes are irritated.\r\n\r\nHow you can know whether you have been exposed to ricin\r\n\u0095\tIf we suspect that people have inhaled ricin, a potential clue would be that a large number of people who had been close to each other suddenly developed fever, cough, and excess fluid in their lungs. These symptoms could be followed by severe breathing problems and possibly death. \r\n\u0095\tNo widely available, reliable test exists to confirm that a person has been exposed to ricin. \r\n\r\nHow you can protect yourself, and what to do if you are exposed to ricin\r\n\u0095\tFirst, get fresh air by leaving the area where the ricin was released. Moving to an area with fresh air is a good way to reduce the possibility of death from exposure to ricin. \r\no\tIf the ricin release was outside, move away from the area where the ricin was released. \r\no\tIf the ricin release was indoors, get out of the building. \r\n\u0095\tIf you are near a release of ricin, emergency coordinators may tell you to either evacuate the area or to \u0093shelter in place\u0094 inside a building to avoid being exposed to the chemical. For more information on evacuation during a chemical emergency, see Facts About Evacuation. For more information on sheltering in place during a chemical emergency, see Facts About Sheltering in Place. \r\n\u0095\tIf you think you may have been exposed to ricin, you should remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. \r\n\u0095\tRemoving your clothing: \r\no\tQuickly take off clothing that may have ricin on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head. \r\no\tIf you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible. \r\n\u0095\tWashing yourself: \r\no\tAs quickly as possible, wash any ricin from your skin with large amounts of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect people from any chemicals on their bodies. \r\no\tIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and put them with the contaminated clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes (even if they are not disposable contacts). If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put your eyeglasses back on after you wash them. \r\n\u0095\tDisposing of your clothes: \r\no\tAfter you have washed yourself, place your clothing inside a plastic bag. Avoid touching contaminated areas of the clothing. If you can't avoid touching contaminated areas, or you aren't sure where the contaminated areas are, wear rubber gloves, turn the bag inside out and use it to pick up the clothing, or put the clothing in the bag using tongs, tool handles, sticks, or similar objects. Anything that touches the contaminated clothing should also be placed in the bag. If you wear contacts, put them in the plastic bag, too. \r\no\tSeal the bag, and then seal that bag inside another plastic bag. Disposing of your clothing in this way will help protect you and other people from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. \r\no\tWhen the local or state health department or emergency personnel arrive, tell them what you did with your clothes. The health department or emergency personnel will arrange for further disposal. Do not handle the plastic bags yourself. \r\n\u0095\tFor more information about cleaning your body and disposing of your clothes after a chemical release, see Chemical Agents: Facts About Personal Cleaning and Disposal of Contaminated Clothing. \r\n\u0095\tIf someone has ingested ricin, do not induce vomiting or give fluids to drink. \r\n\u0095\tSeek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. \r\n\r\nHow you can get more information about ricin\r\nYou can contact one of the following:\r\n\u0095\tRegional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 \r\n\u0095\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \r\no\tPublic Response Hotline (CDC) \r\n?\t800-CDC-INFO \r\n?\t888-232-6348 (TTY) \r\no\tE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov \r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/27/2004\r\n\r\nChoose correctly\r\nWhether you vote for President Bush or not, be sure to do one thing\u0097get the facts straight.\r\nIn this time of over exaggerated, slandering, political commercials, it's vital you understand where each candidate stands on the issues.\r\nJust because \"The Right\" overwhelmingly dominates Eastern Washington doesn't mean people shouldn't take the time to do some research. Expand your mind and think.\r\nSomeone once said, \"Conservatism is sometimes a symptom of sterility. Those who have nothing in them that can grow and develop must cling to what they have in beliefs, ideas and possessions. The sterile radical, too, is basically conservative. He is afraid to let go of the ideas and beliefs he picked up in his youth lest his life be seen as empty and wasted.\"\r\nBe your own person and choose wisely.\r\n/s/ Eric Amador, Seattle, Alderwood High School class of 1995\r\n\u00a0\r\nRe-elect Bush\r\nWhen people look back at the Bush Administration in years to come, they will see that the No Child Left Behind Act was one of the most significant pieces of legislation signed into law in decades. Why?\r\nBecause it puts educational standards into place for all students. This is especially important for low income and minority students, too many of whom have fallen through the cracks in our public education system over the years. Results are already showing up in our local school districts, as well as in other districts that have struggled across the country.\r\nAs with so many other issues, President Bush is a noteworthy exception to the average politician. When he encounters a problem, his response is not to complain or blame someone else for the problem. His response is to try to solve the problem.\r\nWe don't often have a president with the vision to lead in this fashion. But we can certainly keep this one for four more years. Please join me in voting to re-elect George W. Bush.\r\n/s/ Sandra Linde, Outlook\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrivatization\u0097at what cost?\r\nThe proposal to privatize Alderwood's public works department raises some important issues.\r\nHaving lived in an urban center on the west side of the state for several years, I had the opportunity to observe the performances of a number of agencies that chose to employ privatized service providers. Privatization was generally initiated by new management, often not long term residents of the locale, interested in trimming the budget. The tactic was to persuade the general public that eliminating such expensive items as decent living wages, cost of living allowances and health benefit packages would lower the cost of city and county services and provide a financial boost for the local economy.\r\nHowever, a major consideration was ignored: when a public works crew, like the one in Alderwood, dedicates a consistent work effort, shows concern for the needs of the public, and invests time and money in the community voluntarily, as residents, outside of the work schedule.\r\nThe result is that not only do the new \"privatized\" employees fail to respond in a timely fashion to citizens' needs, but they are not invested in the community. So the quality of performance is heavily diminished.\r\nI would hope that the people of Alderwood are willing to carefully scrutinize the proposal to privatize the public works department. It would be, in my opinion, a major error in judgment.\r\n/s/ Sonja McDaniel, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe \u0091Little\u0092 Council of S\u0092side (Related to The Little Red Hen)\r\nOne day as the little Council of Alderwood was struggling, having issues with clean air, clean water and quality of life;\r\n\"This should be resolved,\" they said. \"Who will help us with this problem?\" \"Not I,\" said Yakima County. \"Not I,\" said Yakima Clean Air Authority. \"Not I,\" said New Vision.\r\n\"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they did.\r\nSoon, the need to measure and define the problem came. \"The problem is ripe,\" said the Council of Alderwood. \"Who will help us measure and define?\" \"Not I,\" said the Washington Dept. of Ecology. \"Not I,\" said the Washington Dept. of Agriculture. \"Not I,\" said the Washington Dairy Federation.\r\n\"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they did.\r\nWhen the issues were defined and partners were needed to help resolve, the Council of Alderwood said, \"Who will partner with us in this endeavor?\" \"Not I,\" said the Alderwood Port District. \"Not I,\" said the Alderwood Inc. board. \"Not I,\" said the Alderwood Chamber of Commerce.\r\n\"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they did.\r\nWhen the issue became political, the Council of Alderwood said, \"Who will help resolve these politics?\" \"Not I,\" said Dan Newhouse. \"Not I,\" said Bruce Chandler. \"Not I,\" said Jesse Palacios.\r\n\"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they tried.\r\nThey addressed the issue to the press and asked for fair and balanced reporting. Then asked, \"Who will report the information fair and balanced?\" \"Not I,\" said the Dark Side News. \"Not I,\" said the Yakima Herald. \"Not I,\" said the Tri-Cities Herald.\r\n\"Then we will,\" said the Council of Alderwood. And they tried.\r\nThey negotiated the deal, paid the costs, became their own partners and made it a win-win.\r\n\"Who will take the credit and benefit from this?\" \"Oh! I will,\" said the Port. \"Oh! I will,\" said the County. \"Oh! I will,\" said the State.\r\n\"No, no,\" said the Council of Alderwood. \"We will do that.\"\r\nAND THEY DID.\r\n/s/ John Torch, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nWhy buy a car?\r\nRecently, I went into a local automobile dealership in an attempt to trade-in my car. I didn't get a new car, but did get confused and somewhat shocked with the whole \"trading in your car\" business. I understand that a dealership needs to make money in order to have a viable business, but how much is too much? And at whose expense?\r\nLike many of your readers, I know the difference between the retail values and and the trade-in values. But it wasn't until my last negotiating attempts that I really grasped what it meant.\r\nLet's assume that a trade-in value for a car is $2,500 less than the retail value. Automobile dealerships will not typically pay more than the trade-in value of a car, which means they automatically make a $2,500 profit.\r\nFurthermore, the cars at dealerships are typically overpriced by an average of $4,000 (from what I have been told by friends in the car business). This means that if you trade in your car at the trade-in value rate and buy a car at the retail value, the dealership would make $6,500 in one deal. Imagine that!\r\nNow...imagine this happening to about 50 deals a month. That totals $325,000 in profits in one month.\r\nAutomobile dealerships are out to take advantage of consumers. It's not like if consumers can just say to heck with it. The reality is, consumers need transportation to survive. The price that dealerships blindly force consumers to pay, however, is an outrage.\r\nConsumers, including myself, need to be thoroughly educated on the type of deals they are getting into. After all, it's not a well kept secret that cars are a bad investment. If you don't really need a new car, why reinvest into yet another money shortfall.\r\n/s/ Ana Gonzales, Grandview\r\n\u00a0"

        "text":"Tacitly Yours\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/15/2004\r\n\r\nWednesday night I listened to the third and final presidential debate, and it wasn't so much what the candidates talked about during the debate that grabbed my attention. Instead, it was the discussion that took place after the debate that I found most interesting.\r\n\r\nI have watched or listened to all three of the presidential debates, spending time after each listening to the commentary that takes place from both parties. It's funny, but after each debate both parties work hard to declare their candidate as the winner. I've always thought it was funny that a presidential debate would have a winner to begin with. Maybe I'm a bit naive, but I always thought the presidential debates were meant to inform voters about each of the candidate's policies, and not to see who can \"win\" more of the debates.\r\n\r\nRegardless, after each debate the candidates' parties spend time simply reiterating what their candidate said. They are also sure to do what they can to make the opponent look bad.\r\n\r\nBut Wednesday night, what really caught my attention was that the post debate conversation wasn't about which side looked better, sounded better or was wearing the best tie. Instead, it was about finding the truth in what each candidate had said.\r\n\r\nI was listening to National Public Radio (NPR) and I appreciated that the station had taken the time to get ahold of experts, not experts associated with any particular party, but experts who know the policies and history behind each candidate.\r\n\r\nI sat there and was blown away by some of the things that came to light during the post debate conversation on Wednesday night. I listened with interest as experts pointed out that some of the numbers Sen. John Kerry used during the debate when talking about employment rates were correct, but only if you excluded a large part of the job market - the government, which has seen a growth. I also listened as the experts pointed out that Kerry was incorrect in saying that President George Bush never took time to meet with the Black Congressional Caucus. Instead, the experts said Bush did meet with the caucus, but only when they boarded a bus and arrived at the White House uninvited.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter which side of the fence a person is on, be it Republican or Democrat, I think there should be more reporting on the truth behind what each of the candidates say and less on the mudslinging that takes place nearly every election.\r\n\r\nI mean, should I have been shocked that NPR decided to look into the truth behind the words, instead of asking the different parties for their opinions on the debate. I think instead of being surprised by that type of debate reporting, that type of reporting should be expected. Don't voters deserve to know the truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The money is used for dues, uniforms and other expenses the girls have, said Gatica. There are 90 troops in the Mid Columbia Council. Six of those troops are in Grandview, five in Alderwood and one in Outlook.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since she learned the news, Gatica and other parents of Girl Scouts have been working to raise the money needed, finding individual donors and businesses interested in supporting Girl Scouts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A lot of parents just don't have the funding,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The troop also made a donation to the fund.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outlook Daisy Girl Scout troop #397 donated half of its winnings for their booth at the Yakima Valley Fair and Rodeo to the \"Give from the Heart\" fund. The other half of the money, or $75, will be used to purchase ceremonial flags, which will be needed as the girls transfer from Daisies to Brownies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The vibrant red display at this year's Grandview fair featured pictures of the girl's activities, as well as the goals the Daisy Scouts learn to live by.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were not expecting to win,\" said Gatica.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As part of this past year's activities they Outlook group made \"Girls are Great\" suncatchers, said Gatica.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their scrapbook highlighted events such as the Daddy-Daughter Dinner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They made invitations for their dads and for half an hour they got to sit down with their dad or grandfather, an adult male who cares about them,\" said Gatica.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the dinner, the girls made each of their dad's favorite dish for the meal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The girls also had a Mommy and Me Tea, said Gatica.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We taught them how to serve, and etiquette,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The girls had a Got Sweats drive at Outlook Elementary School and were able to collect three huge boxes of clothing, which will be used for students at the school this next year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the clothing drive, Gatica said, the girls had to find five additional acts of service that they wouldn't normally do.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's about going out and making yourself a better person,\" Gatica added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've already seen a change even in my own child, in her behavior and how she treats people,\" said Gatica.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those interested in donating to the Give from the Heart fund can call the Girl Scout Council, (800) 967-8113.

She expects to hold a new opening in Seattle in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor the time being, she is enjoying the winery's visitor's reactions to her work, which is largely centered on a Greek mythological theme.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The use of astrology and mythology has a prominent place in her work as she combines themes such as Helio's son's tragic experience with Helio's chariot steeds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I've always had a need to express my feeling about the universe in a logical way, based on my life's experiences,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nLeonardo, who loves to add an underlying element of storytelling in her work, enjoys working with concepts like supernovas and exploring the effects of weightlessness. The power of her feelings resonates from each of the 12 paintings currently on display at the Zillah winery.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe current show closes Sept. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bonair Winery, at 500 S. Bonair Rd. on the Zillah Fruit Loop, is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n"

        "text":"Port adopts aggressive two-year plan\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/23/2004\r\n\r\nThe Port of Alderwood is moving ahead on schedule, meeting its list of industrial development project deadlines as outlined in its a two-year work plan.\r\n\r\nThe Port Commission, working with local agencies such as the City of Alderwood, Alderwood Inc., and state and federal funding agencies, now has on its drawing boards several large scale projects, said Amber Hansen, Port manager.\r\nAmong those projects is the Port's sequence batch reactor (SBR), which is slated to be constructed this year, Hansen said. She said construction is actually expect to begin on the SBR as early as mid-February. She said 14 construction bids have been received for the $5 million construction of the SBR.\r\n\r\nThe Port annually contracts with Alderwood Inc., a local economic development group, to assist in marketing the Port District's industrial and business-zoned properties to companies seeking to expand into the Lower Valley, Hansen explained.\r\n\r\nShe said as part of Alderwood Inc.'s involvement with the Port, its three-man Commission expects the agency to aid in bringing new businesses to the Port, including its East Edison industrial park.\r\nPort officials are also counting on the development agency to aid in marketing the Port's ongoing efforts to ensure environmentally safe operations with the construction of the SBR and its proposed wetlands habitat project, Hansen explained.\r\n\r\nShe said the SBR, a facility to more efficiently clean Port users' industrial wastewater, will make the Port's Midvale Road industrial wastewater treatment facility much more effective in returning clean water to the Alderwood Valley River.\r\nAs part of the Port's two-year plan, work is also proceeding with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' study of the Port's wetlands habitat project.\r\nHansen said the Corps feasibility study is expected to be completed in 2004. The design phase for the project is expected to begin in 2005, with construction to follow in 2006.\r\n\r\n\"We expect the habitat to be ready to receive the Port's treatment facility water by 2007,\" she said.\r\nAdditionally, the Port is now planning the design and construction of a new operations and laboratory building, which is expected to be completed later this year.\r\n\"We also expect to have the interior of our industrial park incubator building completed and ready to be rented in the near future,\" she said.\r\nThe Commission also expects to have completed the development of the industrial park by the end of 2005.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"City Council's 2005 budget relatively unchanged\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/16/2004\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood City Council spent Monday night's 2005 budget study session combing through several department budgets, including the legislative fund.\r\nThe legislative fund is allocated for Council operations. The proposed 2005 budget for the legislative fund is $38,210, which is up from $37,740 in 2004.\r\n\r\nOne of the significant expenditures in the legislative budget totals $14,000 for salaries and wages. Council members pointed out to City Manager Tom Rockford that there will probably be money left from the 2004 budget since Council scaled back the number of meetings it has each month from four to two. Council members are paid $40 for each meeting they attend. The mayor receives $200 a month, while the mayor pro-tem is paid $90 per month.\r\n\r\nCouncil did approve moving $4,000 from the salaries and wages line item for other services and charges. This will help cover expenses for trainings and various organizational meetings.\r\nThe legislative fund also has $7,000 set aside for expenses such as travel, insurance and office supplies. Funding for the beautification awards also comes out of this fund.\r\nThe largest expenditure in the legislative fund is for intergovernmental services, which totals $16,000. Rockford said this is money Alderwood County charges for election costs.\r\n\r\nCouncil did incur a large travel budget in 2004, said Rockford. There had only been $1,000 budgeted for travel, but the amount so far charged to the account is $4,100. Rockford said the extra expense is from Council searching for a new city manager.\r\n\r\n"

The members include one administrator, two students, five parents and four staff members. Also included on the list of those planning to participate in the process are four ex officio members.\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Aaron Bones said he interviewed all of the applicants and narrowed it down to the 12 he was recommending to the board. He said the people on the committee are a very diverse, but a very balanced group.\r\nHe added that parents who were appointed to the board all have children who are attending school and are all actively involved in their children's education.\r\n\r\nThe people who make up the committee include Harrison Middle School Principal Janie Hernandez, Alderwood High School students Julian Stroh and Mira Mendoza, parents Tim Bardell, Suzie Zamarron, Marilyn Van Oostrum, Mike Shuttleworth and Sandra Linde; staff members Patty Griffith from Harrison Middle School, Stacey Alseth from Alderwood High School, Dalia Gonzalez from Chief Kamiakin Elementary School and Tina Peabody from Alderwood High School. The ex officio members include School Board member Joanne Kilian, Jan McDonald with Lower Valley Pregnancy Center, Berenise Martinez with Planned Parenthood and Sister Mary Rita Rohde with Nuestra Casa.\r\n\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"School board dedicates new Alderwood parent center\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/24/2004\r\n\r\nThe community of Alderwood has a new place to go when it comes to resources to help better the achievement of both children and parents in the local school district. Thursday night, the Alderwood School Board, as well as representatives from the Northwest Community Action Center and Education Service District 105 gathered together to celebrate the dedication of the new parent center at 810 E. Custer Ave. in Alderwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jesse Garza, executive director of the Northwest Community Action Center, said his organization has been working with the Alderwood School District on its parent center for the past five years. He noted that one of the things that helped make the center possible was a grant that was received through the Department of Education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood Executive Director of School and Community Resources Ruben Carrera said the center will offer parents a place to come and learn about different resources available through both the school district and the community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrera also noted that the parent center includes a technology center. The computer lab serves as a place where parents can come in and take computer classes or simply take advantage of the technology.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"You never stop learning, no matter what the age,\" Carrera said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones took time Thursday night to congratulate everyone who was involved with making the center possible. He added that although the center will serve as a central hub for parent activities and resources, it does not diminish the parent involvement efforts taking place at the different schools in the district.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the dedication, school board members and several administrators walked across the parking lot to the Denny Blaine building for the school board retreat. During the retreat the board members talked about a variety of topics, including further discussing parent involvement, looking at the salary schedule for all district employees and touching on school safety.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Susan Martin, the parent involvement coordinator for Educational Service District 105, said she has been working with the local school district on its parent involvement component since last May.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What I truly believe is that all families want what is best for their children,\" Martin told board members.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Martin then commended the board on taking a proactive stance on parent involvement, noting that they are ahead of many districts when it comes to taking steps to actively include parents in their children's education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Family and school together, can help all students be successful,\" Martin said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrera added that although the opening of the parent center is a big step, the process of getting parents involved in school is ongoing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"You've laid a great path and it's going to be an exciting journey,\" Martin said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the board retreat, Human Resources Director Debbie Holwegner and Payroll Officer Pauline Schut took time to walk the board through the 2004-05 salary schedules and agreements for the different positions in the district.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Holwegner and Schut showed some of the different salary schedules to the board members, Bones made some comments about some of the changes that have taken place in regards to the different salaries scheduled for the 2004-05 school year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He pointed to the salary schedule for classified administrators, which include positions like the transportation supervisor, noting that this is the first time there has been a salary schedule for these positions. He explained that in the past the different positions have each had their own salary range. This year all of those positions have been brought together, with all of the salaries also having been brought closer together and put in the same salary schedule.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones said another change to the salary schedule involves principals in the district. Bones said principals have been year-around employees. He said this is because many principals were often found in their buildings in July, dealing with everything from new hires to getting things organized for the next school year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nJohn Hughes, safe and effective schools director, took time to talk to the board about the upcoming Washington State Health Youth Survey, which is administered every two years to sixth, eighth, tenth and twelfth graders. Hughes said this year will mark the third time the test has been administered in the school district.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hughes said the test will be administered sometime between Oct. 11 and 15. He added that the surveys are anonymous and voluntary, and deal with everything from bicycle safety to drugs and alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hughes said the district has also been working on putting together a curriculum for younger students that deals with irrigation canal safety. He said the district received a $5,000 grant from Pacific Power to work on the curriculum, which is being created with help from both kindergarten teachers and students. He told board members he is currently searching for an illustrator to draw the coloring books that will make up the curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones then talked about different subjects the school board would like to bring up when they schedule a joint meeting between the board and city council.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones said he would like to talk about different partnerships between the two entities and working to ensure that services are not being duplicated. He said the different subjects he would like to see discussed include looking at aligning all of the early learning programs in the community on the same page, working to get children ready to enter kindergarten. He said he would also like to see the subject of technology discussed, because technology is something that affects everyone in the community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the subject of adequate yearly progress, Executive Director of Instruction and Learning Gary Vegar said many of the schools in Alderwood are showing signs of making a lot of progress. However, schools in the district are still struggling to make adequate yearly progress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We just need to keep the course,\" Bones said, noting that the district has done a lot of work when it comes to literacy and trying to prepare students for the Washington Assessment of Student Learning exams.\r\n"

        "text":"Monson family will continue operating cattle feed mill\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/8/2004\r\n\r\nThe Monson family may be moving its cattle feedlot operation out of the Alderwood area, but that doesn't mean the Monsons won't be conducting business here.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday's announcement that the city of Alderwood had purchased the 150-acre feedlot from the Monsons didn't include the news that an adjoining 20-acre site will be kept in the family holdings. Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford confirmed yesterday afternoon that the Monsons will continue operating their custom feed operation on that 20-acre parcel of land.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"They will be retaining the milling operation,\" Rockford said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0City of Alderwood officials, after several months of serious discussions with the Monson family, struck a deal to purchase the 150-acre feedlot for $2.5 million. The money will be paid in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the site.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The money to be paid to the Monson family won't be generated by implementing local taxes or fees, or by asking local citizens to approve a bond measure. Instead, the city is making an internal loan to itself, from invested reserves that are currently yielding low returns. At the present time, Rockford said Thursday afternoon, the city has approximately $7 million tied up in invested reserves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As part of the agreement, the Monsons will not have any cattle delivered to the feedlot after February of next year. The sales agreement also stipulates that all of the cattle, which routinely number more than 2,000 on any given day, will be removed from the site no later than Aug. 31 of next year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most in the community are viewing the purchase of the feedlot, located near the west entrance into Alderwood along Yakima Valley Highway, as positive news. Proponents of the purchase agreement expect an improvement in the air quality, and expect the western corridor into Alderwood to be brightened with either residential, business or industrial developments.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wednesday evening's announcement that a deal had been brokered with the Monson family also included the news that the Monsons will be responsible for the clean-up of the site. That is to include the removal of the corrals and outbuildings on the 150-acre site, as well as the removal of the manure and \"black soil.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockford explained yesterday that the \"black soil\" is the soil that is situated immediately below the accumulation of the cow manure.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He further detailed that plans do not include filling in the site with fill dirt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We should be able to go in and just level the site,\" Rockford said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because of the high nitrate level in the soil, as recent test results have indicated, it is highly probable that the city will contract with a local farmer to plant a crop at the site once the clean-up and removal of \"black soil\" is completed. Rockford said a crop such as alfalfa will leach many of the nitrates out of the soil. He added that if the clean-up goes according to the timeline set up in the agreement, a 2006 fall planting is possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In responding to which party would be responsible for any future claims against the property, ecologically speaking, Rockford said federal statute clearly defines that area of the law.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Whoever causes any such issue is held responsible,\" he said. Rockford said that is not a concern, though, as tests have revealed there is no ground water contamination at the site.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The future development of the 150-acre site is unclear at this time. Rockford said no one has shown an interest thus far in purchasing any of that land from the city, which is how Alderwood officials hope to recoup the $2.5 million they are borrowing from invested reserves.\r\n"

        "text":"Beyond The Norm Mel\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/20/2004\r\n\r\nIn the days before the absentee ballot was a common form of voting. There were the giant voting booths with the buttons and levers that allowed people to cast their vote for their favorite candidate.\r\n\r\nGoing to the voting booth with my mom I remember hearing the loud noise the machine made as the votes were being recorded. Someone once told me they missed the old machines because they really felt like their vote was being counted with the pull of the lever and loud clanking noise.\r\n\r\nA lot has changed in the past 20-some years. Now, many people in Alderwood County vote by absentee ballot. I used to, but decided that I want to actually go to the voting booths this year. (You can change from voting absentee to voting at the polls by filling out a voter's registry and asking the auditor's office to change your method of voting.)\r\nSince I have voted absentee for several years, I decided it was time to return to the polls.\r\n\r\nPart of my decision, admittedly, is due to the new electronic voting system that has been put into place. I never really liked the voting ballots we had to punch with the \"high tech\" tab puncher. When I was in college voting absentee it was with a pencil or a pen. I think what really soured me on the former ballots is the forever seared image in my mind of a vote tallier in Florida holding a ballot up to the light, his glasses on his forehead, looking to see if there was any indication that the chad could still be attached and checking to see if other chads had been dimpled in a possible attempt to vote for the other party.\r\n\r\nI never realized there were so many possible ways to interpret a vote.\r\nI really don't like the new absentee ballot, which is larger than a road map and harder to use.\r\n\r\nDuring the primary I felt like I was plotting my route to buried treasure while trying to figure out which candidates I wanted to cast my vote for.\r\nI am excited to get my hands on the new voting machines. I think it will be an interesting step in the evolution of voting.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of sad that the machines are so quiet. Maybe they can be programmed to make the large clanking noise when people cast their final votes, or maybe they can just have a voice say, \"You just voted.\"\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Alderwood Civil Service Commission amends lay-off rules for fire department\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 7/22/2004\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood Civil Service Commission last night changed the rules to how a personnel reduction will be handled by the Alderwood Fire Department.\r\n\r\nCommissioners Rey Pascua and Mike Hughes cast their votes in favor of making the changes to the rules. The third Alderwood commissioner didn't arrive at Wednesday's meeting until after the vote was taken.\r\n\r\nAccording to City Attorney Bruce Rinz, there was question as to the language of the rules dealing with lay-offs at the Alderwood Civil Service Commission's last meeting in December. Rinz said because of budget constraints last December the city was forced to eliminate the deputy chief position in the fire department.\r\n\r\n\"This brought up the question, what happens under civil service rules?,\" said Rinz.\r\nHe said the language of rule 14, which deals with laying off employees, has been described as murky. After working with Lloyd Hazzard, Adam Dent and Bud Jones of the fire department, a revision was written which will help clarify the rule, said Rinz, who added that an example is also included.\r\n\r\nThe rule now states that in cases of lay-off, temporary employees will be laid-off first. Among regular employees, the least senior employee will be reduced in rank to the next lower classification. The person in that classification will be reduced in rank to a lower position until the person with the least seniority in the lowest rank is laid off.\r\n\r\nWritten into the rule as an example, said Rinz, is that if the position to be reduced is battalion chief, the least senior battalion chief will be reduced in rank to captain. The captain with the least seniority will be reduced in rank to firefighter and the firefighter with the least seniority will be laid-off.\r\n\r\nRinz said the firefighter who is laid-off will be added to a re-employment list, which will be valid for two years.\r\nOriginally, the rule dealing with re-hiring said that employees would be able to return to work if their certifications were kept up to date, but Rinz said there is a problem with that since when an employee is laid off they lose their ability to maintain certification. Instead, the rule reads that the employee will have to acquire the certifications within six months, or a time approved by the city manager, when hired back. Kunker said in some cases there are tests that are only held every few months and an employee could potentially miss the date of the test depending on when they are re-hired. An employee would also be required to pass a physical agility test.\r\n\r\nWith the changes to the civil service rules, the Commission decided to wait until the next meeting to approve the revisited general rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Commission did approve changing its meeting time to the second Wednesday of every month, at 5 p.m. at the Alderwood Law and Justice Center.\r\n\r\nAt last night's meeting the commissioners also approved the Alderwood Police Department's request for an exam for lateral and entry level patrol officers.\r\n\r\n\"We're anticipating possible openings within the next month or two,\" said Alderwood Police Chief Ted Mana.\r\n\r\n\"We would like to have a list available if we choose to fill those positions,\" he added. \"We do not currently have an active list.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners voted unanimously in favor of holding testing. The civil service exam for the Alderwood Police Department will be held Saturday, Aug. 28. Sign-ins will begin at 6:30 a.m. at Harrison Middle School with the physical agility testing beginning at 7 a.m. The oral boards will be held at the Alderwood Law and Justice Center that afternoon.\r\n"

        "text":"Hart Beat\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 2/6/2004\r\n\r\nThe older I get the more I realize how small the world is and how connected each of us are to each other. That fact was hammered home recently after listening to a trio of ambassadors from the north.\r\n\r\nWho doesn't remember seeing photographs of the piles of British beef being destroyed when the mad cow disease hit that nation? Who doesn't recall hearing that the entire European beef industry was nearly wiped out by the fear of the disease?\r\n\r\nWho doesn't remember thinking how easy that scene might have been happening in the United States? It was a nightmarish thought in 1989, and could be reality in 2004.\r\n\r\nAfter listening to a trio of Canadian mayors talk about the near collapse of their communities' economy as a result of last May's discovery of a case of mad cow disease in Alberta, I realized I could be hearing a prediction of the fate of the cattle industry in the Lower Valley.\r\nWhile they shared their stories of economic crisis and attempts to re-establish trade bonds in the lower 48 states, they reminded anyone who would listen that in North America, we are not just neighbors, we're all family and family helps one another.\r\nMany of us have cousins, sisters and brothers living in Canada and in Mexico, a major importers of U.S. and Canadian beef. We are all linked in some way.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian and the United States cattle industries are particularly co-dependent. The Canadians export 60 percent of their cattle, with a large percentage coming to Central Washington feedlots and ranches.\r\nThat all ended May 2003 when that single BSE-infected beef cow was discovered in Alberta, starting an international scare, frightening consumers that their food supply was in danger.\r\n\r\nOur industry leaders are now attempting to shore up food supply safeguards, retain consumers' confidence in the safety of the food supply and reopen our export markets. The Canadians are hoping we won't forget to push for the reopening of our borders to their cattle, as well.\r\n\r\nI don't profess to know much about the condition of our beef industry, but I do know that the closing of American borders to Canadian beef is having a dire effect on the cattlemen on both sides of the border. I know the Dec. 23 banning of American beef to international markets in the Pacific rim and Mexico has cost our nation's cattlemen billions of dollars just in the past six weeks. Now magnify that by nine months of inactive trade. The figure becomes staggering and the effect on communities and families is paralyzing. It is that effect families in Alberta, the heart of Canada's beef industry, are now feeling.\r\n\r\nIt is scary and yet, I am confident our leaders are handling the situation in a matter which will get the beef industry back on track soon. Very Pollyanna of me, I suppose.\r\nI also believe that each of us can do something to aid the cause of both our local cattlemen and our neighbors to the north. One way we can help is to remind our politicians that the BSE crisis affects not only the members of the Lower Valley beef and dairy industry, it impacts Lower Valley shopkeepers, restaurant owners, service providers and yes, even newspaper reporters. We need a return to stability.\r\n\r\nWe all have to support the USDA as it strives to strengthen the safety of our food supply and we have to encourage our local and federal lawmakers to campaign for the reopening of all trade borders.\r\n\r\nWe also have to eat beef and drink milk. We have to make sure it's what's for dinner.\r\nOur Canadian family and local cattlemen will appreciate our efforts.\r\n"

        "text":"Schuette new principal of Stanwood High School\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/13/2004\r\n\r\nA 17-year career in education in the Alderwood School District came to an end at the beginning of August.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jan Schuette, who was the former assistant principal/vocational director at Alderwood High School, was hired Aug. 2 as the new principal of Stanwood High School in the Camano Island School District.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am absolutely thrilled to death,\" said Schuette of her new job.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette recounted with a laugh how she accepted the job on Monday and was in Stanwood by Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stanwood High School serves some 1,600 students freshman through seniors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is somewhat larger than Alderwood,\" said Schuette.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette said the design of the high school is a bit different than it is here in Alderwood. The ninth grade class is in a different complex than the rest of the school.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette has an estimated staff of about 130, including 85 certificated personnel.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette has been working in education in the Valley for a total of 19 years. She spent 17 years in the Alderwood School, 13 as an administrator, and another two in the Yakima School District.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was a wonderful opportunity,\" said Schuette. \"I have always wanted my own building for years. Stanwood is an excellent school. They have a very strong staff and a lot of community support.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette saw the opportunity for a change after her daughter, Ashley, graduated this past year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette is excited about being involved with some new changes going on. She explained the district completed a facilities study and is looking at what to do with such district buildings as the high school, which was built in 1972. Schuette said the district is also focusing heavily on the changes in educational requirements and looking at addressing the dropout rate for students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is exciting,\" said Schuette. \"I am not coming in during the middle of something.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette found out about the job when Gary Vegar accepted the job of executive director of instruction and learning in Alderwood. Vegar was the former principal at Stanwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette has family ties to the Stanwood area. Her sister, Linda Burns, is superintendent of the Arlington School District. Stanwood and Arlington are big football rivals. Schuette said when she went and met the football players a couple of days ago she told them about how important it is to win the rivalry game this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That is going to be fun,\" said Schuette.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood High School Principal Dennis Birr said he is sad to see Schuette go, but didn't want to hold her back from a promising opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She is going to be a real loss to us,\" said Birr. \"She has been an instrumental part of the high school.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Birr said Schuette was key in developing the outstanding vocational program Alderwood has, one of the tops in Eastern Washington.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am going to miss her a great deal,\" said Birr. \"We didn't want to stand in her way. She deserves that opportunity.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to the fact Schuette had to give a short notice of resignation, the high school will be doing some administrative functions differently for this year. Holly Ohler will be let out of a couple of her class periods to assume the duties of vocational director. Ohler completed a vocational director internship under Schuette last year. The administrative staff at the high school will be assuming a majority of Schuette's duties, said Birr. However, Birr plans to utilize administrative intern Ryan Maxwell to assist with the workload.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schuette said she regrets leaving so late in the school year to accept the Stanwood job, but is eagerly looking to come back to Alderwood to visit in the next few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have a lot of ties,\" said Schuette. \"You can't leave some place after working for so long without saying goodbye. I didn't get to say goodbye.\"\r\n"

        "text":"Beyond The Norm-Mel\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/10/2004\r\n\r\nThe other day I was listening to Tim Eyman, yes, Washington's king of initiatives, as he was speaking at the University of Washington.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think the guy is a bit of a nut, there were some things he was saying with which I had to agree.\r\nHe said the whole reason he fought for the initiative process is because he believes that people shouldn't just elect public officials and then just let them run free in their decision-making process. Eyman said he believes people should be continuously active in making decisions that affect their everyday lives.\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking. Shouldn't that be the same for city government? Shouldn't we have a say in what happens with our city services, such as the ambulance? Especially when the council doesn't necessarily represent the opinions of the community.\r\n\r\nThere has been talk of privatizing the Alderwood ambulance service for months. I haven't heard one person (except for the city council) say, \"Yes! Let's get rid of the ambulance service!\"\r\n\r\nIn the time I've been with this newspaper I've never heard anyone complain that the ambulance service in this town is not doing its job. I've heard plenty of complaints about neighboring communities' private ambulance services.\r\n\r\nI haven't always worked in a community with a public ambulance service. When living in Newport, Ore. the county was serviced by a private ambulance service. They had a large, beautiful station that they responded from and answered calls at all points of the county. The service even had a satellite office to help minimize the response time to calls.\r\n\r\nWhat sticks out in my mind is one of the last major accidents I covered while living in Newport. The accident occurred in Lincoln City on Highway 101. The ambulance showed up to assist the fire department and haul the injured to the hospital for treatment. The ambulance, which was the only one available for this major accident, left the scene, but they were not able to haul all of the injured, so they left a man behind in the road bleeding.\r\n\r\nThe man didn't need a backboard or any other kind of special apparatus, but since his car was totaled he did need a ride.\r\nNot knowing how long the ambulance would be, the city firefighters/emergency workers gave the man a ride to the hospital, where he was treated.\r\nFor those who don't know, there is a lot of paperwork the emergency medical technicians and paramedics have to do once they reach the hospital. Some times they are tied up for quite some time. The city emergency workers at this particular accident had no idea how long it would be before another ambulance arrived on scene.\r\n\r\nThe next thing you know, the city was being sued by the ambulance service. The reason they sued was because of a loss of revenue. The company lost the money it would have billed the man for the ride to the hospital.\r\nIs that what we want? Do we want the ambulance service and city in a situation where they could be sued because an outside company lost money due to a lack of responders?\r\n\r\nAmbulance services are often called \"first responders,\" which would indicate that they are some of the first people on the scene of an accident or at a medical emergency call. But that isn't always the case.\r\nWhen speaking to a Grandview resident, she said the Alderwood ambulance service arrived at her home for a medical emergency before her local private service. She now wants her family to call Alderwood first if any other medical emergencies arise at her house.\r\nIf that's what we have in store with a private ambulance service, and if you look back at the history of Alderwood before the start of the public service, you would find similar tales, than I, for one, don't want it!\r\nWhy is it that the best services offered by this town are on the city council's chopping block? That makes no sense! Financially speaking, the council may think it looks good on paper, but we're talking about the quality of life for the whole community.\r\n\r\nFor a council that says it is so concerned with quality of life issues, why don't they look at some of the basic ones, such as the police, fire, water, sewer and parks and recreation. These are all services that are better when the community has direct control over them, not when they are farmed out to some conglomerate, whose first concern is the bottom line.\r\n\r\nThe council may not see these departments as offering quality of life services, but I tell you what, if it came down to whether I want a proven ambulance service available to tend to my emergency needs or spending taxpayer money on the removal of a feed lot, I think I'll opt for the ambulance service that's currently in place.\r\n\r\nI think that what the council is forgetting is that quality of life is just that...it's living. The living, breathing, walking people of this community are what are important. Sure, it would be great if we didn't have the cow smell that wafts into town every once in a while, but if we don't have the critical services to help the people of the community, then why are we living here?\r\n"

LaFever explained that Cornejo has been working on a new serving style, which she tried out against Othello.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She had a long string of serves that really dominated the game,\" LaFever said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said that the serve Cornejo is using is something she picked up while playing against some larger 4A schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cornejo had a good night overall with 6 aces, 16 service points, 3 kills and 4 assists. Also helping out the Lady 'Hounds were Chante Bottineau with 8 digs and 18 assists, Kealey Johnston with 10 service points, 3 kills and 11 digs, Danelle Cowan with 9 kills and 2 blocks, Angie Cabrera with 2 kills and 7 digs, Valentina Solis with 10 kills and 3 service aces, Jessica Gonzalez with 8 service points, and Tonhya Wysong with 1 kill and 14 digs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nLaFever said the game with Othello marks one of the last few matches the team will be forced to play on the road.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They are going to come to our place to play us now,\" LaFever said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the Lady 'Hounds (5-0, 6-1)return to their home court they will be taking part in the Wenatchee tournament Saturday afternoon.\r\n"

        "text":"MOOvin' out\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/7/2004\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, Alderwood,\" City Councilman John Torch exclaimed joyfully last night after the announcement that the Monson family had agreed to sell its 150-acre feedlot to the city.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFollowing a 25-minute specially called executive session Wednesday evening, city officials reconvened into open session and released details on the impending $2.5 million purchase of the cattle feedlot owned by the Monson's. The purchase of the land, located west of Alderwood between Outlook Road and Yakima Valley Highway, is being viewed by many as not only a quality of life improvement for local citizens, but as a way to boost economic development in Alderwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A city can grow by default or by design, and this is by design,\" Torch said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The $2.5 million will be paid to the Monson family in three installments, all tied to the phased closure of the cattle operation and the clean-up of the feedlot. Under the terms of the agreement, the Monson's will not have any more cattle delivered to the feedlot after February of next year. \r\n\r\nThe agreement also stipulates that all cattle will be removed from the feedlot no later than Aug. 31 of next year, and that the clean-up of the site by the feedlot owners will be completed by July 31, 2006. The clean-up is to include the removal of corrals, outbuildings, manure and \"black soil.\" The Monson's have also agreed to not operate a feedlot within a 20-mile radius of Alderwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike past proposals in recent years to purchase the feedlot, where local citizens would have had to vote in a bond issue to fund the buyout of the property, Alderwood residents aren't being asked to dig into their pockets this time. The city is financing the $2.5 million purchase by making an internal loan to itself, from invested reserves that are yielding low returns.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We're utilizing our existing cash reserves,\" City Manager Tom Rockford said last night, hastening to point out that raising taxes or implementing fees isn't required to complete the deal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a real win-win situation,\" Rockford added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said the city intends on recouping the money it spends on the purchase of the feedlot by reselling the land to developers. As of right now, he said, the intention is not for the city to hold on to any of the property. Rockford detailed that the 150 acres will be available for development as soon as the clean-up is complete and municipal services are extended to the property.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rockford said the agreement with the Monson family comes after several months of serious discussions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 15 or so people who attended last night's meeting gave the city council and city staff several rounds of exuberant applause as the council signed the resolution that makes the purchase official. One of those in attendance, Ed Werkhoven, took the opportunity to praise those involved with the deal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I congratulate everyone for their persistence on this,\" Werkhoven said. \"You found a way for all of us to win.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The vote to approve the purchase agreement was unanimous by the city council-a rare occurrence considering the volatility and make-up of the group when dealing with major issues in the past. But, there was no conflict last night. All seven of the council members were in whole-hearted accord on the matter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The praise for the deal that was brokered ranged from Councilman Tom Seeger describing last night's actions as \"...a big day for all of us,\" to Mayor Pro-tem George Greenway singling out Rockford as having putting forth a tremendous effort to come to an agreement with the Monson family. Newly appointed Councilman Raul Martinez added his acclaim, citing the efforts of City Attorney Bruce Rinz, as well as Rockford. Martinez also praised the sellers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I thank the Monson's for coming to the table (on this agreement),\" Martinez said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Councilwoman Jennie Angel exclaimed she was excited to be a part of this agreement with the Monson family, calling it \"...a great value for the citizens of Alderwood.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agreeing with her was Councilman Jim Sarducci, who said it's a wonderful opportunity for the city. \"This is the kind of economic development we need to see,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mayor Rex Luthor might have summed it up best, when he said, \"It's truly an investment for the community of Alderwood.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The feedlot in question has been blamed by many over the years as chiefly responsible for the air quality issues local residents complain of on an almost daily basis. The odor and dust problems are expected to dissipate with the removal of the approximate 2,500-head cattle operation. Some in the community speculate property values, especially those homes on Alderwood's neighboring Harrison Hill, will increase once the westside corridor into Alderwood has been transformed into a business or industrial district.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nLocal realtor Hank Timmermans, though, isn't so sure local residents will see the value of their homes increase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't foresee any large increases in property values,\" Timmermans hesitantly answered when contacted this morning, adding that he was caught off-guard by the inquiry. Timmermans did explain that the Lower Alderwood Valley area is comprised chiefly of moderate to low income families, and he doesn't believe there will ever be a large market for higher priced homes. He said if property values were to rise too much, most people living in the area would be unable to afford the purchase of higher priced homes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kenny Nelson of DK Bain Real Estate Inc. agreed with Timmermans that residential property values probably won't rise in Alderwood as a result of the elimination of the dust and odor problems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"But the quality of life will definitely be a major improvement,\" Nelson said emphatically. \"Maybe people will start looking at moving to Alderwood instead of looking to move into Grandview or Zillah.\"\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Casino/restaurant opening planned\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/20/2004\r\n\r\nRob and Sue Rice of Alderwood, as well as a handful of investors, are gambling that opening a casino in the Lower Alderwood Valley will be a sure bet with local residents.\r\n\r\nThe site of the new casino will be the former Alderwood Elks lodge, located right next door to Black Rock Creek Golf Course. The lodge was sold several years back and reopened as the Fairway Restaurant. The restaurant was closed earlier this year. The monstrous building is now in the hands of the Rice's, who are the general partners and majority owners of RS Kids LLC, made up of a small group of investors intent on offering adult entertainment in the Lower Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood couple is quick to point out that its new venture, to be called RC's, is much more than just a casino. A restaurant offering formal dining, as well as a sports bar and banquet rooms, will hopefully draw a wide array of people into the new establishment, they say.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant and sports bar are tentatively scheduled to be opened on Nov. 16. The Rice's are planning for a Dec. 1 opening of their casino.\r\n\r\nThe site being developed for the new business, along Alderwood Valley Highway between Alderwood and Grandview, lies in an unincorporated area of the county. As such, all gaming taxes generated at RC's will go into Alderwood County coffers. There is a potential for the county to net a quarter of a million dollars annually from the gambling taxes.\r\n\r\nA more realistic figure, says Mr. Rice, (perhaps conservative depending on who you talk to), is that $180,000 will be generated in gaming taxes each year. Rice bases his estimate on how similar sized mini-casinos have fared in other communities in Washington state.\r\n\r\nAlderwood County commissioners earlier this year, at the request of the Rice's, lowered the gaming tax rate from 20 percent to 10 percent-the same rate the City of Yakima assesses card room and mini-casino owners doing business in that municipality. RC's will be the first casino from which the county will draw taxes.\r\n\r\nIronically, the approximate $200,000 expected to be netted in gaming taxes each year at RC's could have gone into the City of Alderwood's bank account. In June 2002, the Rice's sought permission from the city to expand their bowling center, to include a mini-casino. Their business, Valley Lanes, is located in the heart of the city, directly across from the high school on Edison Avenue.\r\n\r\nBut when the couple began making inquiries at city hall in late May 2002, the Alderwood City Council quickly enacted an emergency moratorium on accepting license applications for house-banked card rooms. Later that year, in November, despite the Alderwood Planning Commisson's recommendation to allow mini-casinos in the city, the Council vote unanimously to prohibit any such gambling activities within the city limits.\r\n\r\n\"Our first choice was to do business in our own town,\" said Rice, a native of Alderwood who has operated several businesses in the city, including the bowling center he now operates and several mini-marts.\r\n\r\n\"Being forced out of the city to do business, we've had to spend more money than we wanted to,\" he continued. \"The plan had been to offer an all-in-one package at the bowl, although the casino would have been separate from the bowling end of it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat has Alderwood lost?\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, the $180,000 in taxes each year,\" said Rice. \"Who couldn't use that kind of money?\r\n\r\n\"Our original plan was to have an all-inclusive entertainment center at the bowl. It was something we wanted in Alderwood, something that could appeal to families.\r\n\r\n\"The fear might have been that a card room would bring in trouble,\" he continued. \"But card playing doesn't bring in the trouble. It's the alcohol that can cause problems.\r\n\r\n\"But we were already serving alcohol at the bowl. We didn't have trouble with that, and we still don't.\r\n\r\n\"There's not a lot of entertainment options in Alderwood. We wanted to add something to the community,\" said Rice, a professional bowler who still takes time to compete at several PBA events each year despite his hectic business schedule.\r\n\r\nThe Rice's have not had to deal with the City of Alderwood on their current endeavor. Their new casino doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the local municipality. The processing of the paperwork and permits has been through the Washington State Gambling Commission and with the county. Final approval from the state is expected within weeks, if not days.\r\n\r\nAlthough the City of Alderwood won't directly benefit from taxes generated at RC's, there will be an economical benefit via the creation of between 50 and 70 new jobs at the casino and restaurant. The Rice's are currently advertising the job openings, which include everything from managers and floor supervisors, waitresses, dealers, security and surveillance personnel to cooks, cashiers and dish washers. Rice said the salaries should range from an average of $3,000 a month for management to $9 to $13 an hour for the other staff members.\r\n\r\nThe casino end of the business at RC's will offer gaming enthusiasts several options of play. Already in place are two poker tables, which will afford card players both open play and tournament style action. Seven other gaming tables will also be operated on a daily basis, featuring such games as Blackjack, Pai Gow, Spanish 21, 3-Card Poker and Texas Shootout.\r\n\r\nRice said the casino tables will be opened to customers in the late afternoon, with a closing time at 2 a.m.\r\n\r\nWith the way the Rice's have configured the upstairs hall of their new building, the dining areas will be closed off from the casino.\r\n\r\n\"We want it so families who aren't interested in the casino can still come out and have dinner in just a restaurant setting,\" Rice said.\r\n\r\nThe formal dining establishment will offer a full dinner menu, \"...but there will be a flare for Italian food and steaks,\" said Rice. Chef Rick Grindrod, who specializes in Italian food and desserts and has such stops as Snipes Mountain Restaurant and the Barn Restaurant on his resume, has already been secured to oversee the operation of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nRC's will also offer its patrons two sports bars, one of which will be a no-smoking section. Rice said numerous television screens, featuring a varied sports package, will be operating around the clock for the enjoyment of all sports enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nAlso being made available to Lower Valley residents are two banquet rooms. Additional banquet seating may be added in the ground level of the building at a later time if the need arises.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, the Rice's plan to expand the current parking area to mirror that of their neighbor-Black Rock Creek Golf Course. Down the road, said Rice, lighting and landscaping improvements are planned.\r\n\r\nBlack Rock Creek PGA head pro Jeff Bender welcomes Rice and the casino next door to the Alderwood golf course. Bender said based on what he has seen first-hand at the bowling center operated by the Rice's, he's expecting a well operated, well maintained business that will complement the entertainment the golf course provides.\r\n\r\n\"My vision is that golfers will come here for tournaments, we'll give them a couple of drink coupons and eat lunch here, and then after the awards ceremony we'll give the golfers $25 in casino chips and go have dinner next door,\" Bender said.\r\n\r\nSuch an arrangement suits Rice, as well.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to be competitive in terms of specials for our customers,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"The bottom line is we want a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere here. We want people to come out for dinner, whether they're gamblers or not.\r\n\r\n\"It's a big investment. But it all came down to numbers, based on the area's population. We felt there is enough people here to warrant putting in something like this,\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"But I'll be honest, it would have been difficult to do this without the relationship we have with some other casino owners we know. They have made it possible. They've been a very valuable asset to us.\r\n\r\n\"Our dream was to offer the people here a true entertainment center,\" he added. \"Unfortunately, the only thing that will be missing out here is the bowling center.\"\r\n"

It has no medical or other practical use. \r\n\u0095\tLewisite is not found naturally in the environment. \r\n\r\nHow people can be exposed to lewisite\r\n\u0095\tPeople\u0092s risk for exposure depends on how close they are to the place where the lewisite was released. \r\n\u0095\tIf lewisite gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin contact or eye contact. They may also be exposed by breathing air that contains lewisite. \r\n\u0095\tIf lewisite liquid is released into water, people may be exposed by drinking water that contains lewisite or by getting the water on their bodies. \r\n\u0095\tIf lewisite liquid comes into contact with food, people may be exposed by eating the contaminated food. \r\n\u0095\tPeople can be exposed by coming into direct contact with liquid lewisite. \r\n\u0095\tLewisite vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas. \r\n\u0095\tLewisite remains a liquid under a wide range of environmental conditions, from below freezing to very hot temperatures. Therefore, it could last for a long time in the environment. \r\n\r\nHow lewisite works\r\n\u0095\tAdverse health effects caused by lewisite depend on the amount people are exposed to, the route of exposure, and the length of time that people are exposed. \r\n\u0095\tLewisite is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that immediately damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. \r\n\u0095\tBecause it contains arsenic, lewisite has some effects that are similar to arsenic poisoning, including stomach ailments and low blood pressure. \r\n\r\nImmediate signs and symptoms of lewisite exposure\r\n\u0095\tMost information on the health effects of lewisite is based on animal studies. \r\n\u0095\tSigns and symptoms occur immediately following a lewisite exposure. Lewisite can have the following effects on specific parts of the body: \r\no\tSkin: pain and irritation within seconds to minutes, redness within 15 to 30 minutes followed by blister formation within several hours. The blister begins as a small blister in the middle of the red areas and then expands to cover the entire reddened area of skin. The lesions (sores) from lewisite heal much faster than lesions caused by the other blistering agents, sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustards, and the discoloring of the skin that occurs later is much less noticeable. \r\no\tEyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur on contact. \r\no\tRespiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough \r\no\tDigestive tract: diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. \r\no\tCardiovascular: \u0093Lewisite shock\u0094 or low blood pressure may occur \r\n\u0095\tShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to lewisite. \r\n\r\nWhat the long-term health effects may be\r\n\u0095\tExtensive skin burning, as seen with sulfur mustard, is less likely. \r\n\u0095\tExtensive breathing in of the vapors may cause chronic respiratory disease. \r\n\u0095\tExtensive eye exposure may cause permanent blindness. \r\n\u0095\tUnlike sulfur mustard, lewisite is not known to suppress the immune system. \r\n\r\nHow people can protect themselves and what they should do if they are exposed to lewisite\r\n\u0095\tLeave the area where the lewisite was released and get to fresh air. Quickly moving to an area where fresh air is available is highly effective in reducing the possibility of death from exposure to lewisite. \r\no\tIf the lewisite release was outdoors, move away from the area where the lewisite was released. Go to the highest ground possible, because lewisite is heavier than air and will sink to low-lying areas. \r\no\tIf the lewisite release was indoors, get out of the building. \r\n\u0095\tIf you think you may have been exposed, remove your clothing, rapidly wash your entire body with soap and water, and get medical care as quickly as possible. \r\n\u0095\tRemoving and disposing of clothing: \r\no\tQuickly take off clothing that has liquid lewisite on it. Any clothing that has to be pulled over the head should be cut off the body instead of pulled over the head. If possible, seal the clothing in a plastic bag. Then seal the first plastic bag in a second plastic bag. Removing and sealing the clothing in this way will help protect you and other people from any chemicals that might be on your clothes. \r\no\tIf you placed your clothes in plastic bags, inform either the local or state health department or emergency personnel upon their arrival. Do not handle the plastic bags. \r\no\tIf you are helping other people remove their clothing, try to avoid touching any contaminated areas, and remove the clothing as quickly as possible. \r\n\u0095\tWashing the body: \r\no\tAs quickly as possible, wash any liquid lewisite from your skin with large amounts of soap and water. Washing with soap and water will help protect people from any chemicals on their bodies. \r\no\tIf your eyes are burning or your vision is blurred, rinse your eyes with plain water for 10 to 15 minutes. If you wear contacts, remove them and place them in the bags with the contaminated clothing. Do not put the contacts back in your eyes. If you wear eyeglasses, wash them with soap and water. You can put the eyeglasses back on after you wash them. \r\n\u0095\tIf you have ingested (swallowed) lewisite, do not induce vomiting or drink fluids. \r\n\u0095\tSeek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. \r\n\r\nHow lewisite exposure is treated\r\n\u0095\tTreatment consists of removing lewisite from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting. An antidote for lewisite is available and is most useful if given as soon as possible after exposure. \r\n\r\nHow people can get more information about lewisite\r\n\r\nPeople can contact one of the following:\r\n\u0095\tRegional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 \r\n\u0095\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \r\no\tPublic Response Hotline (CDC) \r\n?\t800-CDC-INFO \r\n?\t888-232-6348 (TTY) \r\no\tE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov \r\n\r\nThis fact sheet is based on CDC\u0092s best current information. It may be updated as new information becomes available.\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protects people\u0092s health and safety by preventing and controlling diseases and injuries; enhances health decisions by providing credible information on critical health issues; and promotes healthy living through strong partnerships with local, national, and international organizations.\r\nPage last reviewed February 22, 2006\r\nPage last modified March 14, 2003 \r\n"

        "text":"'Doc' pushes GOP platform\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/20/2004\r\n\r\nCongressman Richard \"Doc\" Hastings has been in the political arena for nearly three decades. Last Friday, Hastings talked to members of the Alderwood Republican Club, noting that it was nice to talk to members of the local organization again, something he remembers doing for the first time in January 1975.\r\n\r\nHastings talked to members of the Alderwood Republican Club about the Republican National Convention and the coming November election, noting different races that will end up being important to the political party.\r\n\r\n\"We got a good bounce from the Republican National Convention,\" Hastings said.\r\n\r\nHastings explained that he was surprised by just how much of a bounce, or increase in support, the Republican party saw after the national convention. Hastings noted that going into the convention and after seeing the minimal bounce in support the Democrats saw after their convention, he was sure that the electoral nation-wide was pretty well divided. He thought that was why the Democrats didn't see the bounce they typically do.\r\n\r\n\"But polls showed it was different,\" Hastings said.\r\nHe said he thinks one of the reasons that Republican have seen growing support since the national convention is because of something President George W. Bush said during his speech. Hastings said he thinks the key was when Bush started talking about the country's future.\r\n\r\nHastings then turned his attention to Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. Hastings said the Democratic party, through Kerry's campaign, is trying to make the candidate into something he is not. Hastings said, for example, the Democrats are the ones who decided to make Kerry's service in the Vietnam War an issue during the campaign.\r\n\r\n\"The fact he focuses on this...invites others to look at the facts,\" Hastings said.\r\nHastings added that by focusing on Vietnam, Kerry's team is turning attention away from something that is important - his voting record in the Senate.\r\n\r\n\"We all develop our records,\" Hastings explained. \"When you start voting on things it should be a pretty good indication to exactly what you stand for.\"  Hastings said he feels that one of the reasons people are choosing to support Bush over Kerry is because people know what Bush stands for. \"He's more steadfast,\" Hastings said.\r\n\r\nHastings added that Washington is a state Bush is hoping to win in the November election, adding that Eastern Washington will play a big part in making that happen.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hastings, the Bush/Cheney campaign is in the middle of starting grassroots efforts in battleground states, like Washington, to ensure that Republicans get out and vote.\r\n\r\nIn other races across the state, Hastings said Republican candidates are putting in a good showing. He noted that in the race between George Nethercutt and Patty Murray, Nethercutt is beginning to make gains in the polls while Murray's numbers are beginning to plateau.\r\n\r\n\"George is working extremely hard,\" Hastings said. In the race for governor, Hastings said Republican candidate Dino Rossi is looking good against Christine Gregoire. He said in a poll conducted by Rossi the Monday before the primary election, he was within three points of Gregoire.\r\n\r\n\"That's very significant for a guy who's never run statewide,\" Hastings said. In the end, Hastings told members of the Alderwood Republican Club that in November it's all going to come down to getting people out to vote.\r\n"

        "text":"Story Time\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/25/2004\r\n\r\nElection time is drawing near. Here in the Alderwood Valley, not only are we faced with the arduous task of choosing which candidates to vote for, we must do so using a brand new primary system. And to top it off, for those of us who still trek to our polling sites to cast our votes, we'll be voting on state-of-the-art machines that are bound to confuse and dismay the electronically-challenged (yes, I fall into that group).\r\n\r\nYou can blame the \"hanging chad\" for the new computerized voting machines. Damn those Floridians.\r\n\r\nAs for the new primary election system that will be in place this September, it's kind of difficult to figure out who to hang the blame on. You can curse both political parties if you choose, since both Republicans and Democrats were in favor of doing away with the old primary system. Personally, I throw the blame at our judicial system-or more specifically, those judges who refused to uphold the old system when the whole, sordid mess was sorted out in court. Seems like everything we're allowed to do, or forbidden to do, these days is decided in court, doesn't it? Instead of a majority-rule society, all of the important decisions are being made by single entities-namely, those justices who sit with gavel in hand and robes flowing, spewing out the turns and twists we must make in our lives.\r\n\r\nBut I digress. The point of this column is to point out the difficulties we all face in choosing the right candidate for the job at hand.\r\n\r\nThis year's elections offer no real local races, with the exception of two county commissioner spots that are coming open. When it comes to voting for a city councilman or school board director, most of the time we're all familiar with the people who've thrown their hats into the ring. We base our decisions in those kinds of races on our personal dealings with the candidates, or on the encounters our friends have had with those running for public office. Word of mouth spreads quickly in small rural towns like ours, and it's not all that difficult to choose the right person for the job.\r\n\r\nIt's a different matter when it comes to voting for the president of the USA, or for a U.S. senator, or a governor or a public lands commissioner. We don't really know the people running for these highly visible jobs. They don't live in our communities-who are they, what do they represent, are they qualified to do the job?\r\n\r\nVery few of us actually do the research or the reading required to select the best man or woman for the job. Instead, we are made privy to sound bytes-30-second commercials (which usually downgrade their opponents instead of filling us in on what the qualifications of that particular candidate are), and we use this useless information to help us decide on who to vote for.\r\n\r\nMany among us vote straight Republican or Democrat. That eliminates the chore of learning who the candidate is. If they're a Republican, we figure chances are they're against abortion, want to stimulate the economy by lowering businessmen's taxes and are in favor of strengthening the military. If the candidate is a Democrat, most of us voters assume he or she wants to make college accessible to every person in the entire world, believes in raising the taxes of the rich and wants to outlaw every handgun that exists in this country. Heaven help a candidate who declares himself an independent. Most voters figure such a person is a non-conformist, a looney of sorts, and would not be effective in public office.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't live in a black and white world. There are many gray areas when it comes to politics. Not all Democrats subscribe to every mandate detailed in the national Democratic platform, the same holds true for Republicans and the national platform they have adopted.\r\n\r\nBut we don't take the time, or make the time might be more accurate, to look into the lives of these candidates and what they stand for.\r\n\r\nSo who do we vote for?\r\n\r\nYou tell me. I'm open to suggestion. From now until the elections are over in November, I encourage you to write a letter to the editor and we'll publish your reasons why we should vote for a particular candidate. Convince me your candidate is the right person for the job.\r\n"

Voters approved that tax earlier this year. \r\n\r\nCouncil members then relinquished control of the library to the county-wide system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The regional library system is set to take control of the Alderwood library at the beginning of 2005.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greenway suggested the partnership with the local school district because he said he feels city residents will be shortchanged by the regional library system. Greenway said the financial figures regional library officials are releasing show that Alderwood residents are paying more into the system than they are getting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think we can take that same 50\u00a2 and do just as good or better,\" said Greenway.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Councilwoman Jennie Angel, who is involved with the Alderwood Library Board, said regional library officials do have a plan in place to improve the local facility. Angel said she would like to see them given the opportunity to improve the facility before any talks of taking back the library happen.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones didn't rule out such a discussion between the district and the city. Bones did caution there would have to be some changes made in the materials offered at the library if the district managed the facility because of the youths who would use it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.

        "text":"Alderwood Inc. director Marshall Doak to leave post\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/22/2004\r\n\r\nAlderwood Inc. Executive Director Marshall Doak has announced he will be leaving the economic development agency to go into private business.\r\nAt the same time, he announced that the agency he has worked for during the past two years will be undergoing an identity change.\r\nDoak said he departs the agency as it is undergoing a name change.\r\n\"We have dropped the incorporated title and have changed our identity to better express what we are about,\" he said.\r\n\r\nDoak said the Alderwood economic board of directors voted in August to change its name to \"Alderwood Economic Development Association.\"\r\n\"We even have a new logo, created by DeLeesa Sarducci, which expresses the board's dedication to diversity, the community and growth,\" he explained.\r\nDoak's resignation is effective Oct. 31. However, he said he will continue to make himself available to the board as the transition to a new director is made.\r\n\r\nHe said the search for a new director is expected to begin within the next several weeks.\r\nDoak, who took on the task of leading the community-based business development agency in June 2002, said he plans to remain in the Lower Valley.\r\n\r\n\"I plan to stay in Alderwood and open my own investment broker office,\" Doak said.\r\n\"I've always believed in entrepreneurship and staying in the Lower Valley offers me a lot of positives for my own business opportunities,\" he said.\r\n\r\nDoak, who said he is proud of the work he has done for the community business climate, said often the general public has not been privy to the Alderwood Inc. work.\r\n\r\n\"The nature of this business is confidentiality. But we are always interfacing with developers on some level,\" he said.\r\n\"This has been a fun and exciting job and I find it continues to be an exciting time to live in Alderwood,\" he said.\r\nDoak said during the past week he has been in talks with a number of commercial developers who are in the pre-development stages of their plans.\r\n\r\nDoak said as he leaves the Alderwood Economic Development Association, he is working with several groups on commercial and residential developments, who are actively seeking to develop properties in the community.\r\n\"Some of these are past the interest stage and are moving into the pre-development stage,\" Doak said, adding he expects to be making some announcements in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n\"I expect we'll be making some announcements about new developments in the coming weeks, perhaps days,\" he said.\r\n\r\nDuring his two years as the Alderwood economic development front man, Doak has worked on such projects as the development of businesses surrounding I-82 exit 69, including the siting of the Best Western Motel in Alderwood.\r\n"

        "text":"Hart Beat\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/5/2004\r\n\r\nI recently lost my library card. I didn't put a lost and found ad in the newspaper's classified section, but I was tempted.\r\n\r\nI virtually couldn't function without my library card. I need to know that if I want to check out the latest best sellers for a weekend read, the librarians at Alderwood Public Library aren't going to shake their finger at me and say, \"no card, no book.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't discover my card missing until I attempted to request an inter-library loan of a odd little book of short stories by an obscure San Francisco author. As soon as I found out that my precious blue and white plastic card, engraved with my personal library patron code, was missing, the search was on.\r\n\r\nDuring the three months it took for me to track it down, I was a nervous wreck. Fortunately, after a great deal of searching and retracing of my steps, I eventually found it in one of my summer purses. I had forgotten I had placed my phone card, library card and driver's license in the smaller wallet for convenience this past summer. The phone card and driver's license made it into my fall handbag, but I overlooked my library card.\r\n\r\nBreathing a heavy sigh of relief I immediately had to go visit our Alderwood librarians, first to let them know I had found my card, and then to activate it. I simply had to check out as many books they would let me borrow.\r\n\r\nI have a horrible fear of not having enough reading material available. I like to have reading materials in every room of the house and in my car. In the summer, I like to take books on vacation with me or just to relax with in the back yard.\r\n\r\nMy library card allows me to shift my reading material frequently, while giving me the liberty to explore as many genres of writing as I desire. It's wonderful to have the huge selection of materials afforded me by our library.\r\n\r\nI can't remember a time when I haven't made use of public libraries. I've loved them since I discovered there are thousands of books just waiting for my eager mind to absorb. One of my first jobs was cataloguing my little school library, a job which found me reading more than sorting.\r\n\r\nMy children started going to the library as infants. They spent a lot of hours chewing on the covers of books while I read them bedtime stories. I accessed the library for information about parenting and childhood illness. I found recipes to try on the families and books to decorate our home. I taught my children to love books using the library system.\r\n\r\nMy oldest daughter and her husband are passing that love of reading on to their small family. My grandchildren are also avid library patrons, going to the library several times a month to check out new reading material, movies and music. They use the Internet, via the bank of public access computers. Even the youngest member of our family, Moose, makes use of the many games and puzzles available for the littlest library patrons.\r\n\r\nThe library is well used by my family and many others in the city of Alderwood.\r\n\r\nI agree with First Lady Laura Bush, who has been quoted as saying that her library card is the most valuable thing in her wallet. I know it is in mine.\r\n\r\nI want to keep it in my possession, which is why I urge everyone to vote for the proposed annexation of the Alderwood Library into the Yakima Regional Library System on Tuesday, March 9.\r\n\r\nOur city leaders have decided they can't afford to finance our library, as it currently does, beyond 2004, so we, as voters and readers, must vote to keep it open.\r\n\r\nAlderwood city library patrons must decide if they want their families to continue to have ready access to the most precious card in their wallets.\r\n\r\nWe all must say \"Yes\" to the proposed annexation of our library into the Yakima Regional Library System.\r\n\r\nI believe a \"yes\" vote is the best and biggest investment we can make for our children and generations to come. For most of us that will amount to a little more than $4.13 a month on our property tax bill. You can't even buy a paperback novel for that amount. But by paying the extra $4, we have the world in our laps each time we sit down to read a library book.\r\n\r\nJoin me at the voting polls next Tuesday to keep our library intact.\r\n\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Kepcha hopes to unseat Newhouse\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/12/2004\r\n\r\n58-year-old Michael Kepcha knows he has a snowball's chance in Hades of unseating 15th District Rep. Dan Newhouse (R) of Alderwood.\r\n\r\nBut the Washougal resident, campaigning as a Democrat without the support of the party he represents, strongly believes he is the man for the House of Representatives seat in Olympia that Newhouse now holds.\r\n\r\nKepcha, whom Newhouse handily defeated two years ago, swung through Alderwood last week to tout his views on why voters should consider him for the job. \"I know I said I wasn't going to run for public office again after the last election two years ago,\" Kepcha said. \"But nobody else decided to run against him this year.\r\n\r\n\"I'm re-running for the position because of Dan Newhouse. We have different views on what the community needs,\" Kepcha said. \"I might not be as effective as Mr. Newhouse is in Olympia,\" Kepcha concedes. \"But I think a different perspective is needed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about specifics, Kepcha speaks about more funding for the schools. \"I'll fight for money for our school districts,\" he said. \"Every year more and more kids are coming out of high school, out into the job market. \"These kids need to be properly educated so they can find jobs after they're out of school,\" he stressed.\r\n\r\nKepcha, a Vietnam veteran who is unemployed and said he spends much of his time caring for his mother, who is stricken with Alzheimer's, also believes the state needs to find more funding for geriatric and pediatric care. \"We're not spending enough on the medical care of infants or our elderly,\" said Kepcha. \"More needs to be done for the older people in our community, and for the children who aren't receiving the medical care they deserve.\"\r\n\r\nKepcha said making health insurance affordable for all Washington residents is a problem that can no longer be addressed at the state level. \"It's too large of a problem to be fixed in Olympia,\" he said. \"It's something that needs to be fixed at the federal level.\"\r\n\r\nKepcha went on to detail that he disagrees with the Republic Party's torte reform attempts, to put a lid on what people can recover when filing medical claims. \"I agree that the court settlements have gotten out of hand, but people need to have the ability to recover their losses when mistakes are made.\r\n\r\n\"Some kind of cap is probably needed, but not what the Republicans are suggesting. I read somewhere that 5 percent of the doctors are responsible for 95 percent of the claims,\" Kepcha continued. \"The problem could be taken care of if the medical association started to police itself.\r\n\r\n\"We also don't need to put a cap on L&I claims or settlements. I've met families who have been injured on the job. They need the money they're entitled to, all of it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nKepcha also disagrees with the state GOP that Washington needs to recalculate how the state's minimum wage is adjusted each year. \"We don't need to freeze the minimum wage,\" he said. \"We're where we should be at compared to the other states.\"\r\n\r\nKepcha said his chances of unseating Newhouse are slim, but he wants to give the voters of the 15th District an alternative when they vote in November. \"The two of us definitely don't have the same views. I'm the other choice,\" said Kepcha.\r\n"

        "text":"Food Fore Thought\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/19/2004\r\nSuzie Loffer\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that there is a political bias to the press but what is often discounted is its ability to permeate all facets of our society. Until the sixties, the food we ate and how we chose to eat was neutral territory. Not any longer.\r\n\r\nThe way food is raised, processed and ingested is an integral part of our nation's politics, spawning movements and reflecting media bias. The November issue of Vanity Fair magazine is no exception, rather another alarming example of undisciplined journalism, with an underlying political motive to discredit our nation's beef industry in response to their donations to the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nSince beef producers and Greenways in general don't reside in Vanity Fair's predominantly urban circulation areas, it is imperative they are made aware of the glaring cover currently being read this month in grocery lines across America that states \"America's Beef is Rotten and Washington Couldn't Care Less.\" Inside is a half page color photo of a very frightened cow with the caption, \"Order the Fish.\" When assertions like this are made, in their sites are the big guns, i.e...fast food restaurants like McDonald's, agri-business conglomerates, the National Restaurant Association and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Sadly, the power of some glib headline impacts those with the most to lose, good ranching families responsible for providing the steaks and hamburgers that have become America's dining heritage.\r\n\r\nThe author, Eric Schlosser, known for his searing expose, \"Fast Food Nation, The Dark side of the all-American Meal,\" masterfully uses E. coli, mad- cow and salmonella to trump up unwarranted fear about beef. In this era of terrorism, he calls BSE America's most \"serious\" food-safety threat, despite the fact that the one B.S.E. infected bovine in Washington state was quickly isolated without an incident. The article even insinuates that there might be a conspiracy theory within the USDA testing program designed not to find BSE.\r\n\r\nIn a lengthy paragraph Schlosser callously sensationalizes the final physical moments of a child's death from E-coli poisoning, attributing it to a hamburger when the evidence was inconclusive, conveniently omitting the fact that bagged lettuce was the source of 28 cases of school children infected with e-coli just last year and 50 teens in 2002. I find it interesting that green onions were notably absent on the November 2003 cover of Vanity Fair, given the fact that a year ago three people died and 510 people contracted hepatitis A from eating green onions imported from Mexico. Did Vanity Fair cover the recent outbreak of E-coli in organic strawberries and lettuce with the same aplomb as they did beef? Unfortunately, we all know the answer.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious by tracking buying habits that consumers don't believe America's beef is \"rotten,\" rather they are appreciative of the branding, pricing and selection now available in their local food sources. It is time to stop politicizing food! As agtivists,, we can show support for America's Greenways and ranchers by boycotting publications that practice irresponsible journalism and refusing to buy the products advertised in them.\r\n\r\nSuzie Loffer represents the Food forethought organization that is an advocate for the agricultural industry.\r\n"

Local \r\nfood merchants will be handing out free samples of local produce. \r\nAlthough Cinco de Mayo is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Mexican Independence Day, it actually commemorates the Battle of Puebla, Mexico, where on May 5, 1862, Mexican patriots defeated a French army.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, Cinco de Mayo is celebrated with more fanfare by Latinos than Sept. 16, which is the official day that celebrates Mexican independence from Spain.\r\n\r\nAlderwood, which has a three-day event that is one of the largest Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the state, plans to kick off its 12th annual event today at 1 p.m. with performances by the St. Joseph School's dance group.\r\nThe dancing will be followed by local bands Aventureo at 3 p.m., Tormenta Musicial at 4:30 and Latin hip-hop DJ music at 6.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the Kiwanis Club's Kids Day Parade winds through downtown Alderwood at 11 a.m. Spanish bands Tormenta Musicial performs at 1:30 p.m. followed by local singers at 2:30, Texas band Grupo Sirerra at 3, Los Luceros de Durango at 5 and Los Heroes at 6.\r\nThe Cinco de Mayo Parade begins at Alderwood High School at 1 p.m. Sunday, followed by the Miss Cinco de Mayo Pageant at 2.\r\n\r\nMariachi Tapatio begins playing at 11:30 a.m. Sunday, followed by Ballet Folklorico at 3 p.m., La Medecina at 4:30, dancing by Los Bailadores at 6 and local band Los Bagantes at 7.\r\nAll performances will be at the corner of Alder and Sixth Street.\r\nThe Alderwood festival also features a downtown street fair and carnival in Swiss Park."

        "text":"Everson girl spends holiday shadowing Alderwood ER nurses\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/7/2004\r\n\r\nUnlike most young people her age, Lindsey Schlotfeldt didn't spend her New Year's Eve holiday skiing or doing other winter time activities. The serious-minded, Everson woman was found shadowing Alderwood Community Hospital emergency room nurses during the days leading up to 2004.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the first year nursing student tagged along with Alderwood ER nurses Kristi Cramblit-Powers and Janice Schell, in order to get a first-hand feel for working the emergency room. She also had the opportunity to visit the medical floor during her two-day job shadow experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schlotfeldt was in Alderwood over the holidays visiting her uncle, Alderwood Police Chief Ted Mana, who had put her in contact with Alderwood Community Hospital.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schlotfeldt's mother, Helen Schlotfeldt, worked at Alderwood Community Hospital nearly 13 years ago at the ER desk, so young Schlotfeldt was familiar with the community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I just wanted to see where she had worked,\" said the 18-year-old Seattle Pacific University student.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Uncle Ed helped me make arrangements to spend time in the hospital emergency room over New Year's Eve,\" Schlotfeldt added. She said she has always wanted to be a nurse. Even though working as an emergency room nurse may not be her future nursing career choice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do hope one day to work in the area of pediatric nursing,\" she explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schlotfeldt said she appreciated the opportunity for the first-hand experience. \"Janice and Kristi, who is one of my mom's friends, were very nice and helpful,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were happy to have Lindsey join us,\" said Schell. \"We hope she had a good experience,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Schlotfeldt's request to shadow professional nurses is welcomed by the hospital administration.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We try to work with individuals who are interested in seeing first-hand the world of nursing,\" said Tom Lathen, the hospital's director of community relations and physician recruitment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said job shadows and on-site tours are one way for the hospital to encourage young people to look up-close at careers in the medical field.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We have scholarships and other incentives available for health careers students and we want to make them available to those interested,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Persons interested in nursing careers or lab technician careers are encouraged to contact Linda Garner, SCH's director of nursing, or Lisa Gray in human resources for more information.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0. Jamie Smart can be contacted at\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(509) 837-4500, or you can e-mail her at jSmart@hawkpress.com\r\n"

Carrera said they will be encouraged to take the state test, but their scores will not count against the schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chase added that allowing students to take the WASL more than once is \"a good thing.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction is also authorized to more ahead with plans to design an additional assessment option for students who have the necessary skills, but experience difficulty demonstrating those abilities on the WASL.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also approved by the legislature was SB 6311, which will allow districts to set their levy base using the amount they would have collected if I-728 and 732 had been fully funded.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Touted as a financial boost to many school districts, Chase said the legislation won't help students in the Lower Valley at all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We never ask for the full amount we can levy,\" said Chase, adding that most schools in the Lower Valley don't ask for full levy funding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The only people that are going to benefit are those in rich districts like Bellevue and Mercer Island, where people live who can afford the full levy,\" said Chase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrera agreed that the levy changes wouldn't help small, impoverished districts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chase added that there was an effort to do away with levy equalization, which allows small districts to receive the same amount of money as larger districts. He said there has already been an effort to cut funding to schools. Last year about 7 percent was cut, and it was not reinstated this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We don't know the full fiscal effects of the new legislation,\" said Chase.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also part of the legislature were policy bills that are expected to enhance the overall health and safety of students. The bills deal with preventing and resolving sexual misconduct cases, enhancing physical activity and improving student nutrition. There will also be increased access to school meals for low-income students and helping prevent child abduction.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nChanges were also made to the state's Learning Assistance Program (LAP). LAP funds can be used for programs for 11th grade students and starting in 2008 they can be used for 12th grade students under the new rules.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They used to limit the grades that could be served by the LAP,\" said Chase. He is unsure of how the expansion will affect school budgets.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also approved, after a decade of failed attempts, was the authorization of 15 new charter schools over the next three years and 45 over the next six years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This issue has been very contentious among education, legislators and our community for years, with both sides raising legitimate concerns and feelings,\" said Bergeson. \"But now that this legislation has passed, we will do the very best we can to make this a positive opportunity for the benefit of students and their families.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Charter schools, I think are a bad deal,\" said Chase. \"They're creating a class and school with less regulations under the idea that with less regulations students should do better. Then why don't they give us less regulation?\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chase said the $67 million the state expects to spend for charter schools would go a long to helping students with such things as driver's education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What I wish they would have passed is low income driver's education funding,\" said Chase. \"Our Valley's going to have a lot of teens out there driving without licenses.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHe added that changing the vote on school issues to a simple majority, rather than the 60 percent currently required, would have also been beneficial to schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Seven seek de la Cruz's vacated city council seat\r\nDate Published to Web: 7/26/2004\r\n\r\nCommunity activism is alive and well in Alderwood. Seven local residents met last Friday's deadline in submitting their applications to be chosen as Alex de la Cruz's replacement on the Alderwood City Council.\r\n\r\nThe 22-year-old de la Cruz, elected just last year to his first term on the Council, abruptly resigned in early July when he was offered a job promotion in Colorado by the management of the KFC/A&W chain.\r\n\r\nSeeking the now vacated Council seat are Bruce Epps, Theresa Hancock, Wade Drysdale, Ermenejildo Rodriguez, Raul Martinez, John Panni and Carol Stone.\r\n\r\nThe seven Alderwood hopefuls will make oral presentations at a future City Council meeting, and will participate in a question-and-answer session with the public. Following that, the six remaining City Council members will select de la Cruz's replacement. Whoever is named to succeed him will have to run for office next year if they intend on retaining the seat.\r\n\r\nEpps, who has been employed as the facilities foreman for the Alderwood Housing Authority since 1995, unsuccessfully campaigned for the City Council in 2001. He lost a tight race against incumbent Tom Seeger that year.\r\n\r\nIn submitting his application for the vacated seat, Epps said he wants to take the city in a different spending direction.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have a personal agenda,\" he wrote in his application. \"I've been in private business and government, so I know both sides of the street.\r\n\r\n\"I've been responsible for government funds, always with a clean audit, so I understand how a lot of the spending works and how the funds cannot be co-mingled,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHancock, a Alderwood High School graduate, is the owner and operator of The Funny Farm, which also serves as a contract liquor store.\r\n\r\nA past member of Gov. Gary Locke's Retail Liquor Task Force, Hancock said the experience and talents she would bring to the City Council include being a life-long resident of Alderwood and a small business owner.\r\n\r\n\"I am open-minded and able to work by consensus,\" she added on her written application.\r\n\r\nDrysdale has been a resident of Alderwood since 1929, when he was a fourth grader. His list of accomplishments include earning a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration from the University of Oregon. In his application he also lists having attended New York University, Oregon State University, the University of Nebraska and Central Washington University.\r\n\r\nHe said early in his career he was employed as a caseworker for the state in its public assistance division. Later in life, Drysdale has been active in real estate sales, rentals and various bail bonds services.\r\n\r\nRodriguez is currently employed as a clerk for Eastway Video. Prior to May of this year, he worked at his father's auto body repair shop in Alderwood.\r\n\r\nA Washington State University alumnus who majored in psychology, Rodriguez said he wants to serve on the City Council because he enjoys \"...communicating and connecting with other individuals and working in politics.\r\n\r\n\"Also, I've been fortunate enough to work with others in different realms of life, and I would like for this opportunity to be my stepping stone to work with other individuals on a larger scale of politics, from the county to the international level,\" Rodriguez wrote in his application.\r\n\r\nMartinez has been a member of the Alderwood Planning Commission for the past four years. He is employed as a supervisor for Framatome-ANP Inc. in Richland, responsible for the firm's quality surveillance department.\r\n\r\nA University of Phoenix on-line graduate, with a Bachelor of Science degree in business management, Martinez said he wants to serve on the City Council because he is deeply interested in the future of the city.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that the knowledge and experience I can offer this position will allow me to make a positive contribution,\" Martinez said.\r\n\r\nMartinez said one of the most important talents he brings to the Council is his ability to work well with others, \"...but also having the fortitude to remain independent and make the tough decision when needed.\"\r\n\r\nA 1990 Alderwood High grad, Panni is a journalist for the Alderwood Daily News in Alderwood.\r\n\r\nFormerly the co-chairman for the Lower Alderwood Valley Rural Enterprise Community's Housing Task Force, Panni said being a life-long resident of Alderwood he knows the issues the community faces and how Alderwood has grown and changed over the years.\r\n\r\n\"The knowledge I have and the contacts I have at my disposal would be a great asset towards the betterment of the community,\" Panni said in his application.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have any great answers as to why I want to serve on the Alderwood City Council. Simply put, I know I won't change the world or Alderwood at the snap of my fingers,\" he related in his application. \"What I do hope is that I can do enough for the community to make it a better place.\"\r\n\r\nStone, a 1974 Alderwood High grad, said she wants to serve the citizens of Alderwood as their voice in city government. She promotes being fiscally responsible with the resources at-hand, and wants \"...to help our city grow, prosper, better itself by always trying my best to do what is in the best interest of all Alderwood citizens.\"\r\n\r\nIn listing her assets, Stone said she works and communicates well with others, is a good organizer and is committed.\r\n\r\n\"I am an independent person who likes solving problems, and I am an optimist,\" Stone said.\r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/17/2004\r\n\r\nStudents shouldbe allowed to defend themselves\r\nDisruption of the educational process, what does this mean to those who administer discipline at Alderwood High School?\r\nI'm writing as a concerned parent to voice the troubles I've had concerning one of my children who attends the high school. My son is a senior this year. Since the ninth grade he has had nothing but trouble with other students harassing him and instigating fights. In every situation he was told to walk away and try to find a teacher to help, which he has done before but still received a punishment.\r\nFirst of all, how many teachers do you think are going to be on top of the situation if they're not aware of the problem?\r\nJust recently my son was harassed again at school by another student. We were not notified. My son told us of the problem. He was pulled from class on one occasion and was told by an assistant principal that it was only the second week of school and he had already been in the office three times.\r\nIn our eyes his problem was being ignored by the same people we think should be concerned with the safety of our children when in school. I've had phone conversations with one of the assistant principals and let him know of the concerns I had for my son, and that I was to be notified in the future if any problems occurred, and that I wanted this problem solved with the other students. I was assured it had been resolved.\r\nTwo days later my son was assaulted from behind. He turned around and defended himself, and tried to walk away but was pursued again. My son was suspended from school for five days because he didn't walk away. The assistant principal's way of looking at it was he should of turned around and walked away. I don't know about anybody else, but doesn't that sound just a little bit strange that if you're being attacked from behind, you should walk away? Maybe if you're Superman, but there are no super heroes here, because if there were we wouldn't have to deal with people like the assistant principals at Alderwood High School.\r\nYou can't close your eyes and pretend you're living in a perfect world. Instead, you should keep your eyes open to reality.\r\nMy point in all this is, what are we teaching students at school? I'll tell you what, we're teaching them, no matter what the circumstances are, there will still be consequences for all parties involved. Where do you draw the line?\r\nI will continue to teach my children to walk away as I have always done in the past. But I do believe that when put in a situation beyond your control, you will and should defend yourself.\r\nWe will, of course, go through the proper channels as we've done in the past, to try to appeal the suspension ruling. But here is where things get really odd. You see, your're allowed to appeal a suspension, but that does not stop the suspension. By the time you go through the appeal process, his five days will already be served. So even if you win an appeal, your child will still have missed school. Shouldn't they wait to see if the suspension is upheld? Does it matter if a suspension is served right away or in a week or two?\r\nThis type of system needs to change and I can only hope it is changed before my other two children attend Alderwood High. Maybe by then there will be a better system. Until then we will have to continue to deal with ignorance.\r\n/s/ Sam Dorsey, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nComplaint needs to be investigated\r\nThis week the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Standards and Official Conduct, also known as the House Ethics Committee, must make a decision vital to our democracy. Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington state is one of the 10 committee members. This group must decide whether to investigate the serious ethics complaint it received against Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas this summer.\r\nAccording to House rules, no other group or party has the power to investigate a U.S. representative. The charges are serious. They involve outright fraud, money laundering and the illegal use of federal troops to push through the redistricting of Texas.\r\nUnfortunately, four of the representatives who are members of the Ethics Committee, including Washington's own Doc Hastings, have taken money from Mr. DeLay or from his PAC in recent years.\r\nWhat does it say for our government when a man charged with engaging in \"pay-to-play\" politics can also pay off the members of the jury that must decide whether to investigate him?\r\nIf the charges are groundless, let an investigation put them to rest. If, however, members of the committee who have been paid by Mr. DeLay lack the integrity either to recuse themselves or appoint special counsel to look into the charges, then America's representative democracy suffers a terrible blow. What confidence can we then have that our representatives in Washington, such as Rep. Hastings, will actually represent the people whose votes sent them there, instead of representing those who fill their pockets?\r\n/s/ Celeste Pagano, Houston, Texas\r\n\u00a0\r\nBlood drawing\r\nThe Red Cross blood drawing held Aug. 31 was sponsored by Alderwood Community Hospital. Yolle Widdows-Guizar was the chairperson.\r\nWe had 79 presenters and four first-time donors.Thirteen were unable to give, leaving 66 units collected. Because of their efforts, 198 people will have another chance at life.\r\nMany thanks to the sponsors for donating the cookies and juice, the United Methodist Church for the use of its hall, Bob Story for publicity in the Alderwood Daily News and Max of Washington Corrugators for displaying the banner at Centennial Square.\r\nAnd then there are the volunteers whose services are always appreciated: Alice Benedetti, Myrtis Lange, Ramona Meek, Ella Mae Lochner and Phyllis Morris.\r\nA very special thank you to the donors, who are the lifeline for the flow of blood in the Valley. Hope to see everyone at the next blood drawing on Tuesday, Nov. 2, at the United Methodist Church in Alderwood, from 1 to 6 p.m.\r\n/s/ Marie Handy, blood drawing chairperson\r\n\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"School board reverses itself, awards bid to Denchel Ford\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/26/2004\r\n\r\nIt is not the cars the office of Migrant Student Data and Recruitment (MSDR) were originally looking for, but nonetheless, MSDR staff does have something now to drive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alderwood School Board cleaned up some confusion at last night's meeting concerning the purchase of a pair of vehicles for MSDR.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood School District serves as the fiscal manager for the MSDR program.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At last night's meeting, the school board approved the bid from Alderwood's Tom Denchel Ford to purchase two 2004 Ford Taurus vehicles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MSDR will be leasing the vehicles from the school district. MSDR will pay the school district for all lease associated costs, such as maintenance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue goes back to the February school board meeting. At that meeting, school board members approved a request from MSDR Director Lee Campos to purchase a pair of Camrys from Toyota of Yakima. The bids from the Yakima dealership were $20,195 for each vehicle, significantly higher than two other bids received. Tom Denchel Ford submitted in February a bid of $14,212 per car for a 2004 Ford Taurus. At the February meeting, the board also received a bid of $13,429 per car from Harris Ford Inc. in Lynnwood for a Ford Taurus. The board went with the more expensive bid under the understanding it was because the MSDR needed the vehicles immediately.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MSDR had received direction from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction to purchase vehicles for its staff. Campos explained in February that his staff members were turning in high requests for mileage checks. MSDR staff members have been using their personal vehicles to travel across the state to track the educational progress of migrant students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day following the February meeting, Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones halted the awarding of the bid until he could clarify some issues surrounding the board's decision. Bones was unable to be in attendance at the February meeting because of personal reasons.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under state law, a governing body using taxpayer dollars has to go with the most conservative bid presented to them unless they can properly justify the reason for going with a higher bid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a special board meeting on March 10, Bones suggested the board reject all bids submitted at the February meeting and readvertise the process. Bones said he felt the bid specifications weren't as specific as they could have been. Bones told the board he wanted the specifications to outline more what the district was looking for.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time around, Alderwood School District Executive Director of Business Dave Plesha suggested the board go with the bid from Tom Denchel Ford. Plesha said Denchel officials told him they could have the vehicles available in the next few days. Plesha said Denchel originally told him it would be up to 45 days before the vehicles could be delivered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The school board actually went with the state bid amount submitted by Harris Ford Inc of $13,773 per Ford Taurus. The catch is that Denchel agreed to match the state bid, which board members approved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original state bid amount was $11,753 per vehicle before taxes. The amount rose with the addition of fees for daytime running lights and a 60/40 split fold rear seat. Following license and title fees the final bid amount increased to $13,773 per vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Denchel agreed to provide all the items that were included in the state bid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of the items that will be featured in the two Taurus cars include side-impact door beams, power front disc and rear drum brakes, air bags, fabric cloth seats, sunglass holder, outside temperature gauge and digital clock, power windows, air conditioning, remote keyless entry with trunk release, cruise control and deluxe AM/FM/Cassette/CD audio with six speakers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood School Board member Fred Kilian said he was glad to see the district accept the best offer for the vehicles. Kilian said the savings will prove out in the long run for the school district.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

Culver told the class he had asked to walk with them. \"I'm very honored to be leading you onto the Clem Senn Football Field for the 8 p.m. ceremony,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Thank you for allowing me to be a part of this class,\" Culver told the graduates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was presented an AHS blanket and an AHS senior mug, as well as an invitation to attend the senior graduation party following Friday night's graduation ceremony.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the rest of the class, who must wear their gowns free of any decoration, Culver will be allowed to adorn his graduation gown with his war medals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among those medals earned while serving in France, Germany and Czechoslovakia are his American Theater Service medal, the European-African Middle Eastern Service medal, a Good Conduct Medal and his World War II Victory Medal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culver, who was sharpshooter with the U.S. Army Company D, 10th Infantry, now lives in Kennewick, where he has been active in the Richland VFW Post for 56 years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culver's opportunity to finally receive his diploma is thanks in part to state legislation created two years ago to honor those in the state who were forced to discontinue their high school education due to service in the war.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culver said it was VFW State Commander Ed Rasmussen who told him about \"Operation Recognition.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He got me the forms and even mailed them in for me,\" Culver said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Culver, who retired from the Teamsters in 1980 and from Hanford in 1987, said he is pleased to be walking with the class of 2004.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They've even asked me to join them at their 10-year class reunion,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'll try to be there,\" he smiled.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Spring Fling evolving into a 10-day festival\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/22/2004\r\n\r\nGRANGER - Spring Barrel tasting may be more than six months away, but area chambers of commerce are already starting to look ahead to the annual event as they makes plans for the next Spring Fling festival.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThursday afternoon, Alderwood Chamber of Commerce Director of Promotions and Tourism Kathy Corliss talked to members of the Granger Chamber of Commerce about the 2005 event and the work that is already going into it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corliss said Spring Fling is an event that has brought together chambers of commerce from Wapato to Benton City. She explained that the Yakima Valley chambers are working together to organize a 10-day festival that will attract those who are visiting the area for Spring Barrel tasting to stay and enjoy what the Valley has to offer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corliss said since the inception of Spring Barrel tasting, the event has grown to such a magnitude that area wineries are beginning to expand, what was once a one weekend event, into a two weekend affair. \r\n\r\nShe said wineries found that as Spring Barrel tasting grew they weren't able to spend the one-on-one time with their customers. Now, wineries are beginning to invite their VIP customers to attend a pre-barrel tasting event the weekend before.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it's that expansion of Spring Barrel tasting that the local chambers are trying to build on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corliss explained that local businessman Tom Denlea, who recently opened the Best Western Grapevine Inn in Alderwood, brought the idea of a Valley-wide festival to the forefront after observing the Tulip Festival that takes place every year in the Skagit Valley. Corliss said Denlea noted that the communities in that area worked together to fill the 13 days of the Tulip Festival with a variety of activities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So when people are in town for the Tulip Festival, they have something to do that isn't necessary tulip [related],\" Corliss said. She added that as a result of the combined efforts the festival brings $16 million in tourism revenue into the Skagit Valley.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said the Spring Fling festival can serve as a way for the communities in the Yakima Valley to take advantage of the many visitors who come into the area for Spring Barrel tasting. Corliss admitted that when planning for the festival first started, the different communities involved were a little territorial. However, as time has gone by the communities have realized that working together is what is important when it comes to making the festival a success.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It has been a great process,\" Corliss said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt this point, Corliss said the group of chambers involved in coordinating the Spring Fling festival are working on preparing the calendar of events. She encouraged any organization interested in putting together an event to come forward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We're excited about it,\" she said, noting that the event is already starting to see growth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other business that took place during the Granger Chamber of Commerce meeting yesterday included the presentation of a check to the Granger Aquatics Committee.

James Grimes and Jose Ramierez were arrested at their homes Sunday, charged with crimimal trespass after a video allegedly showing the duo breaking into a deserted missile silo outside of Alderwood was discovered online by local police. They were released on bond yesterday.  \"We told everyone we could think of,\" says 17 year old Grimes. \"Adults, teachers, the cops. But there is something major going on up there.\" \"That's why we posted the video,\" added 18 year old Ramierez. \"So someone would pay attention.\"  \r\n\r\nAlderwood Police Lt. Jose Hernandez states there is no evidence of other illegal activities on the tapes except the boys.  The silo used to house missile protection for the Groves Weapons Annex south of town, but was abandoned and decommissioned in the early 1990's.  \"Trucks are up there in the middle of the night,\" added Grimes. \"We thought it was a big meth lab that the big farmer dude's [George Prado] running, but I don't know. We found a broken bottle of their stash. It burnt my hand and made me throw up.  But it smelled like gramma's flower garden.\"  \r\n"

This year when the local drama students take to the stage they may be speaking Shakespearean language, but there will be no denying that the play is set in modern times.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the past two and a half months the more than 30 cast members have been working diligently, learning their lines and preparing to bring Romeo and Juliet to the stage.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drama teacher Maisy Sylling noted that she tries to incorporate a Shakespearean play into the high school's repertoire at least once every four or five years in order to challenge her students to learn the language.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for why she chose to do Romeo and Juliet this year, Sylling said that she feels it's a timeless story and one with which students can relate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHowever, she did decide to modernize the play a bit, replacing knives and swords with guns and holsters and 16th century garb with modern-day costumes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's more powerful if it's set in present day,\" Sylling said, noting that it makes it easier for students to relate to.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sylling said those sitting in the audience will have a chance to see a show that will make them think about the challenges young people face, especially if they are in love.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think they will be wrapped up in the story and impressed by the talent of the high school students,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The cast of Romeo and Juliet is made up of about 30 students, with another 25 students working behind the scenes. Sylling said this season's play helped attract a lot of new students to the drama program. She noted that for Tony Magana, who will be playing Romeo, this marks the first time he has been on stage. In the past he has worked as a member of the crew. The role of Juliet will be played by Angela Marin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The play is set to take to the stage at 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, Nov. 12 and 13, and Saturday, Nov. 20. The cost of admission is $3 for students and senior citizens, and $5 for adults.\r\n"

        "text":"Fire captains air concerns with 2005 budget cuts\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/12/2004\r\n\r\nAll three captains from the Alderwood Fire Department-Yan Sing, Tom Siliano and Bud Jones-were on hand at Wednesday's Alderwood City Council budget study session to voice their concerns about the 2005 budget.\r\n\r\nHowever, Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford had a message for the fire department. He encouraged staff to weather the storm and said hopefully things will improve in the future.\r\n\r\nThe budget for the Alderwood Fire Department is divided into three categories-fire control, fire equipment and emergency medical service/ambulance.\r\n\r\nPrior to delving into the budget, Rockford provided Council with some history of how the city has improved the revenue stream for the fire department.\r\n\r\nRockford has revamped the ambulance utility tax fee that was ruled unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court earlier this year. Prior to the ruling by the high court, the city was charging a $3 tax on residents' water and sewer bills. Alderwood voters had approved the tax shortly after the fire department began offering an ambulance service in 1990. Alderwood stopped collecting the tax shortly after the ruling by the court earlier this year.\r\n\r\nThe new version of the ambulance utility fee tax will keep the $3 per month fee, but the amount will now be charged to both residents and businesses. The fee is calculated on the average number of residents living in a home in Alderwood, 3.6. Every business will be charged based on the 3.6 employees ratio up to 100 employees. The new fee will generate $350,000, said Rockford.\r\n\r\nRockford was able to clear up $70,000 in additional money for the fire department by moving expenses over to the ambulance fund.\r\n\r\nThe proposed 2005 fire control budget is $595,410, down considerably from the $639,220 budget in 2004.\r\n\r\nA majority of the fire control budget, $295,480, covers the salaries for the 13 positions within the department. The budget does contain a one-time expense of $6,000 to replace a failing boiler.\r\n\r\nOne area of significant increase is in overtime. In 2004, the city spent $13,370 in the fire control budget for overtime. That figure will rise to $31,306 in 2005. Rockford said overtime expenses are being paid for through a grant the city received. The overtime will go towards training for staff and the 22 members of the volunteer fire department.\r\n\r\nA significant change in the fire department budget is the elimination of two firefighter/paramedic positions. There are currently two staff members serving in the military in Iraq, who are scheduled to return to work next year. Rockford said under the terms of the labor contract the city's fire staff has, the employees with least seniority will be laid off first. One of the positions being proposed for elimination is held by Jamel Linzsey, who is serving in Iraq. The other fireman serving in Iraq is Gregg Hutchinson, who has the most seniority of the two firefighters.\r\n\r\nRockford presented a proposal to Council regarding layoffs. Rockford said that since Linzsey is scheduled to come home from active duty at the beginning of the year, he asked Council to fund Linzsey's position until the time Hutchinson returns from Iraq. Once Hutchinson returns, Linzsey will be laid off from the fire department. The other position set to be cut is that of Josh Roe.\r\n\r\nCouncilwoman Jennie Angel was concerned about laying off any of the firefighters. Interim Fire Chief Adam Dent did acknowledge the fire department has managed without the two staff members serving in Iraq. Dent, though, did say that without a full staff it does make it difficult to provide needed services. Dent said he likes to have four staff members on call each of the 24-hour shifts.\r\n\r\n\"We try to provide the highest level of service to everybody in the community at the same time,\" said Dent.\r\n\r\nAngel asked how much it would cost to fund a firefighter/paramedic position. Rockford said in the neighborhood of $65,00, including benefits.\r\n\r\nMayor Rex Luthor agreed with Angel with her concerns about reducing the staff.\r\n\r\n\"I am nervous losing this large of a percentage of people providing a critical service in the community,\" said Luthor.\r\n\r\nFire Captain Tom Siliano wasn't so optimistic about the department being able to do its job not fully staffed.\r\n\r\n\"It is actually a living hell to be running short,\" said Siliano.\r\n\r\nSiliano said it has been difficult for the captains to do their jobs without a full crew. Siliano expressed concerns about not replacing the fire marshal position, which Dent used to hold. Siliano said those duties, which include conducting fire inspections, will now fall on the captains. Siliano said with more time by the captains being dedicated to fire inspections, there will be less time for important department activities, such as training and being available to fight fires.\r\n\r\nCouncilman John Torch suggested the captains schedule appointments for fire inspections. Siliano said the idea is good in concept, but it won't work. Siliano said it is better to show up unexpectedly, which will reveal more problems and in the end assist the business owners in setting up a safer work environment.\r\n\r\nSiliano said when conducting a fire inspection it is important to see business owners in their every day work environment.\r\n\r\nRockford interjected and offered a few comments about the fire department.\r\n\r\n\"All we expect you to do is do what you can do,\" said Rockford.\r\n\r\nRockford said by taking action now with the budget cuts, the city will be talking about what to do with increased revenues he is projecting down the road in just a few years.\r\n\r\nThe city is getting along now with three less department heads, said Rockford.\r\n\r\n\"Are we taking some risks?,\" asked Rockford. \"What choice do we have.\"\r\n\r\nThe fire equipment reserve fund budget is $163,00 in 2005, up from $148,200 in 2004. The increase is mainly due to $131,000 in grant monies the department received.\r\n\r\nThe EMS/ambulance fund is budgeted at $998,990, which is up from $890,000 in 2004. Salaries account for $449,630 of the budget. The salaries for the fire department are split between EMS and the fire control budgets. The EMS budget will start 2005 with a beginning fund balance of $250,000 and end with a projected balance of $269,580.\r\n\r\nCouncilman Tom Seeger wanted to look into the relationship the city has with Alderwood County Fire District #5. Seeger's concerns dealt with the city firemen, who are also county volunteers, responding to a fire outside city limits. Seeger said he was concerned the city wasn't receiving any compensation for the hours spent fighting county fires.\r\n\r\nCouncilman John Torch wanted to once again begin the discussion about regionalizing county fire department services.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't we start waving our flag,\" said Torch. \"We are the premiere guys.\"\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Groves Annex Chemical Agent Spill Contained; Worker hospitalized\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: June 10, 2004\r\n\r\nA spill of 30 gallons of liquid containing Lewisite chemical agent at the Groves Chemical Weapons Annex in Washington state was contained without harming anyone, the Associated Press reported yesterday. Workers used a mixture of water and other decontamination chemicals on Saturday to clean the area where the spill occurred. It is being done very cautiously and deliberately, said Terry Arthur, spokeswoman for the facility. The U.S. Army said in a press release that the spill of the agent occurred when a worker did not follow safety procedures for handling the material. Alderwood Daily News has learned that Pedro Prado, a security guard at the site and brother of George Prado who owns Excellent Fresh Fruit Farms in Alderwood, was admitted to Alderwood General on Saturday, suffering from multiple lesions and respiratory distress, that are typical symptoms of exposure to this form of chemical agent. The Annex reported that the agent drained into the Toxic Cubicle, a pit in the floor prevents  agent from reaching other parts of the facility. It was then routed to a tank which holds used decontamination liquid. This is the first spill at the site since 2003, Arthur said. The Army said Friday that 2,894 gallons of Lewisite have been neutralized at the facility over the past six months. Officials plan to briefly halt operations this week for a review of progress. Prado's condition is listed as serious.\r\n"

        "text":"Community leaders honored at annual Alderwood banquet\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/15/2004\r\n\r\nAn evening of laughter, surprises and really good desserts sums up the 2004 Alderwood Chamber of Commerce annual awards banquet held this past Saturday night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The award winners' families and friends gathered at Navarro's Family Center to celebrate their well-deserved recognition, as well as an entertaining auction of delectable desserts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than $1,500 was raised from the highly competitive dessert auction, which preceded the announcement of the outstanding citizen awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than 13 desserts, such as a banana cream pie which sold for $150, and a mango cheesecake, that raised at least $80, were offered for auction for the Chamber coffers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the sold-out crowd of banquet attendees enjoyed their expensive, but tasty desserts, the Chamber's outstanding citizens were presented their awards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This year, two Alderwood senior citizens were honored for their many volunteer community service hours.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This town's senior citizens are so worthy of recognition, it is hard to pick just one,\" said Greg Wells, who served as master of ceremonies for the evening's festivities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWells described one awardee as Alderwood Community Hospital's goodwill ambassador and the other as a woman who takes her work home with her. Known as the \"voice of Alderwood Community Hospital,\" Mabel Kluth and American Red Cross and church relief worker Gay Roskamp of the Alderwood Christian Reformed Church shared the Outstanding Senior Citizen award.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long-time Alderwood Pioneer Elementary School Principal Stan Davis and Pioneer Elementary School fourth grade teacher Rose Hall shared the Chamber's Outstanding Educator honor during Saturday's banquet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis, who will retire at the end of the 2004 school year after 30 years in education, was honored for his ability to be an inspiration to staff and students, alike.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall, who has shaped the minds of area youngsters for more than 40 years, currently teaches 26 \"lucky\" fourth graders, said Wells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She makes her students feel as though each is teacher's pet,\" said Wells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlderwood High School senior Stacey Gorski, fresh from claiming grand championship honors at the 49th annual Mid Columbia Regional Science Fair, was named as the Chamber's Outstanding Youth. Wells said Gorksi exemplifies the qualities that adults look for in the young leaders of the community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She is mature and responsible and manages to balance her many activities with a decent amount of fun,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A familiar face at the Alderwood city parks, Luigi Rosal, was honored as the Chamber's Outstanding Public Employee. Wells called Rosal, who has worked for the city for the past 25 years, \"the \"man of the year for his untiring help with community events.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Honored as the outstanding new business in the community was L&M Screenprinting, owned by Marietta and Larry Schmid. The couple opened their Alderwood print shop just a year ago, said Wells, who described the husband-wife team as friendly, multi-talented and community spirited.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They pride themselves on going the extra mile for their customers,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood restaurateur Jose J. Mora of El Conquistador was named as the Outstanding Businessperson of the Year. Mora, who arrived in Alderwood just seven years ago, operates two restaurants in the community, as well as a mobile vendor wagon, said Wells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He's in the business of getting down to business,\" Wells said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alex de la Cruz and wife, Audrey, were honored for their outstanding community beautification efforts at their brand new A&W/Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise on Yakima Valley Highway.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"The appearance of the couple's building and its landscaping is pleasing to the eye and a real benefit to our community,\" Wells said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long-time farmer Cliff Van Belle was honored as the community's \"Outstanding Agri-Businessman of the Year.\" Van Bell, a native Alderwoodr, farms 1,000 acres of wheat, corn, hay and mint.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He plays as hard as he works,\" said Wells. \"He is passionate about snowmobiling, NASCAR and fishing and water skiing with his grandchildren,\" Wells said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. John W. Loffer was named the \"Outstanding Volunteer of the Year.\" Wells described Loffer as a physician who still makes house calls for his elderly patients. He is also the medical director for Lower Valley Hospice and the rehabilitation doctor for Hillcrest Manor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He goes way beyond the call of duty,\" said Wells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He also volunteers for the school athletic programs and the local Boy Scouts of America program,\" Wells added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ruth Barry was awarded \"Outstanding Health Care\" honors for her dedication to nursing education. A clinical instructor at Yakima Valley Community college, \"Barry exemplifies the excellence we want for all medical personnel,\" said Wells.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn addition to the awards ceremony, the Chamber hosted a silent auction during the course of the evening, which raised several thousand dollars for ongoing Chamber projects, said Tom Gaulke, Chamber president.\r\n\r\n"

There was what appeared to be a bullet mark in his left cheek.\r\n\r\nShining Future rebels acknowledged his death was a great blow but would not halt the separatist cause. Catalano's envoy Ramon Prado told AP in Rio De Janeiro the rebels would name a successor within days, but he gave no hint as to who this would be.\r\n\r\n\"A special operation was carried out by us in the village of Maracas as a result of which the international terrorist and leader of the rebel group Armando Catalano was killed,\" Parazuelan Security Service chief Roberto Macapa told Rojas.\r\nMaracas is 20 km north of Palencia.\r\n"

        "text":"Washington voters approve new style of primary election\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/3/2004\r\n\r\nElection day isn't just a day when the next president of the United States is decided. It is also a day when voters get a chance to voice their opinion on the fate of various ballot measures.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This year the ballot measures gave voters a chance to decide on the fate of everything from the presence of electronic scratch tickets at licensed non-tribal gaming establishments to the creation of an education trust fund in the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tuesday, voters came out in force and let their feelings be known.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nInitiative 872\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to the creation of a new primary election format, Washington voters overwhelming voted for change. In Yakima County, 67.8 percent of voters approved the initiative. This mirrors the response from voters across Washington state, where 59.9 percent voted for the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The initiative gives voters a chance to vote for all candidates in a primary election with the top two candidates moving on to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those opposed to the initiative were concerned that the two-top primary could result in a single party election in some races come November.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the State of Washington Voters' pamphlet, the passage of I-872 could mean lowering the annual cost of the primary election system by as much as $6 million from the system currently in place.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initiative 884\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initiative 884 asked voters to approve the creation of an education trust fund by increasing the sales tax across the state by 1 percent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was a measure voted down by voters yesterday. In Yakima County, 60.59 percent of voters voted against I-884. These numbers nearly mirror the results statewide, where 60.74 percent of voters decided against the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those against the initiative pointed to the fact that Washington is already the seventh highest taxed state in the nation and already has one of the highest sales tax rates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those for the initiative felt it would help provide additional funding for the state's education system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the measure had passed it would have increased the state sales tax, which currently sits at 7.5 percent, by 1 percent. This new revenue would have been put aside to help support education throughout the state. According to the Washington State Voters' pamphlet, it would have provided additional funds for K-12 schools, as well as pre-school assistance for low income children and post-secondary education.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initiative 892\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tuesday, voters flexed their muscles and voted down Initiative 892, which dealt with electronic scratch ticket machines.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The initiative would have made it possible for authorized, licensed non-tribal gambling establishments to bring in the same type of gaming machines used at tribal casinos. According to the initiative, the revenue brought in from the additional gaming machines would have been used to reduce state property taxes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Washington state, 60.63 percent of voters marked no on their ballots, leading to the defeat of the measure. In Yakima County, results were very similar with 60.17 percent of voters against the initiative.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Referendum Measure 55\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second education measure on the ballot didn't fare much better than the first. Tuesday, voters in Washington voted down Referendum Measure 55, which would have made it possible to establish charter schools in the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The measure would have made it possible for charter schools to be operated by \"qualified non-profit corporations, under contracts with local education boards.\" \r\n\r\nThe charter schools would have been allocated a certain amount of public funds for operation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, the percentage of voters who voted against Referendum 55 in Washington state is almost exactly the same as the percentage of those who voted against it in Yakima County. Across the state, 58.42 percent of voters voted against the measure. In Yakima County, 58.77 percent of voters voted against it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jim Spady with the Washington Charter School Resource Center noted that he feels the Washington education system is currently in crisis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We must do more to help our educationally disadvantaged students,\" Spady said. \"Charter public schools will help these children, but the voters have apparently decided to give the regular public school system more time to solve this crisis on its own.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initiative 297\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One measure voters across the state turned out to support was Initiative 297, which deals with radioactive hazardous waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The initiative adds new previsions concerning the waste, making it necessary for the waste that is at the site to be cleaned up before any more waste can be brought into the facility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Yakima County, 61.66 percent of voters voted for the measure, compared to 68.51 percent who approved it across the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Proposition No. 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Locally, Yakima County voters approved Proposition No. 1, which called for a three-tenth's of a penny increase in the county's sales tax to help fund the area's criminal justice system.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe proposition will be in effect for a six-year period before it is brought back to the voters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Throughout Yakima County, 56.04 percent of voters voted for the proposition.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proposition is expected to raise $6.1 million annually for the Yakima County criminal justice system, with the funds being dispersed to law enforcement agencies throughout the county.\r\n"

        "text":"Miss Alderwood candidate 2004\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/20/2004\r\n\r\nOne thing Vidi Pasillas prides herself in is being able to see the bright side of people. There is one person in particular who Pasillas sees as a shining star, and that is her younger brother, Juan, who has down syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas is hoping to see the bright sides of many new people as a member of the Miss Alderwood Court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPasillas, 17, who will be a senior at Alderwood High School this fall, is one of eight young ladies looking to represent the community as the 2004-05 Miss Alderwood. The annual pageant will be held in conjunction with Alderwood's Sunshine Days Saturday, Sept. 18, at the Alderwood High School auditorium.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas is a native of Alderwood, having lived in the community her entire life. Pasillas credits the strong women in her life with helping her become the person she is today. Pasillas has particular praise for her mother, Maria Rangel, and her grandmother, Elena Zuazo.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas is being sponsored in this year's pageant by Blueline and Les Schwab Tire Center.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At high school, Pasillas stays very active. She is involved with Link Crew, which is a group of older students who help incoming freshmen make the transition to the high school. Pasillas is also involved with the leadership class and the Leaders in Action program. Her other school activities include Key Club, cheerleading and fastpitch softball.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside of school, Pasillas has volunteered at the Just Like Home retirement center and the local food bank. Another of her loves is working with the Special Olympics program. Pasillas became involved with Special Olympics through her brother. After high school, Pasillas wants to attend college to study to become a special education teacher.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"He (Juan) inspired me to go in that line of work,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When working with Special Olympics, Pasillas said she is at her happiest because she feels she is making a difference.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think it is really fun,\" smiled Pasillas. \"They (Special Olympics members) are just funny. They are very honest.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This year will mark the third season Pasillas has been involved with cheerleading.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It (cheerleading) was kind of like a little girls' dream,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas explained she's had a desire to be a cheerleader since she was a little girl. Pasillas acted on that dream when she was a sophomore.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I tried out and I was so nervous,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another of Pasillas' loves is the sport of fastpitch softball. She has been playing softball since she was in middle school.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When I was in middle school I was kind of the quiet kid,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said none of the other sports such as basketball or volleyball appealed to her much.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas recently found her niche at the prep level on the mound this past summer, where she developed into one of the premiere arms for the Lady Grizzlies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But being involved with family and friends is what Pasillas treasures most. Pasillas said she looks up to her mom and brother. Pasillas said she admires her mom for being a single parent, but always finding time to still support her children.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She is going back to school (college),\" said Pasillas. \"I am real proud of her.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas said her brother also taught her an important lesson about life.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My brother has taught me not to be judgmental about people,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why run for Miss Alderwood?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think it is a great opportunity for any young lady to experience,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas said if she is named to the Miss Alderwood court she wants to inspire young children. Pasillas said she would love to serve as a role model for young girls, inspiring them to compete for Miss Alderwood when they are older.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas said she has great respect for the role the Miss Alderwood Court serves in the community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They (Miss Alderwood court members) are making the community a better place,\" said Pasillas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas did admit she was a bit reluctant at first to vie for the Miss Alderwood title.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't sure if I would have the time to do it,\" said Pasillas. \"But then I thought, you only live once, you might as well do it to the best of your abilities.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Pasillas enjoys about the community is the people and the diversity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Everyone is really friendly,\" said Pasillas. \"We are able to get to know each other.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas has several projects she wants to work on if appointed to the Miss Alderwood Court. Her featured community service project will be working with the Special Olympics organization. She would also like to start a project through the Alderwood Veterans of Foreign Wars post, sending letters from the community to troops serving abroad.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas said she would be honored to serve on the Miss Alderwood Court.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I would be so excited,\" said Pasillas. \"I would be very honored because it is something I have worked so hard for.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pasillas said being involved with the Miss Alderwood pageant, at the very least, she is hoping to develop friendships and treasured memories.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is something to think about when you are 80,\" smiled Pasillas.\r\n\r\n"

She knows their idiosyncrasies, what they buy, how they like the money in their wallets arranged and what time they will walk through the door every day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have a lot of customers who come in every day,\" said Ramirez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most of her customers live in the neighborhood, but she said that she also has numerous out-of-town visitors coming to her business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said that people from Arizona, Utah and other states come to her store looking for directions or a place to eat. Some have even asked for directions to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's amazing how many people visit this town,\" said Ramirez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I get a lot of people here asking where the Dairy Fair is or how to get to the winery,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite all of the visitors, the Alderwood Mini Mart is still a neighborhood store.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Ramirez first bought the business, it was slow, but with a few changes, including ripping the signs out of the windows, she saw an increase in business. Through the summer there was a steady stream of business, she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ramirez had a desire to own her own business for a number of years. A former medical transcriptionist and assistant for a lab, she decided then, that one day she would work for herself.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I used to have to pick up specimens and take them to the lab,\" said Ramirez. \"One time I had a leg. It was in the back of my car and I was afraid it was going to come back to life,\" she chuckled.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She took some time off before her youngest went to school, but when he stated attending classes full-time, she knew it was time to get out of the house.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ramirez opened a book and Bible store before she bought the corner market from a friend. She had worked occasionally at the mart to help her friend, so she knew the ins and outs of the business.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I knew she worked a lot, but I had no idea how much,\" Ramirez said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said it was a difficult decision to close the bookstore, but when the opportunity to purchase Alderwood Mini Mart opened up she and her husband decided to try their hand at grocery retailing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since purchasing the market Ramirez has expanded the amount of products she carries. She has also expanded the lunch items and added breakfast tacos to the menu.\r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 7/7/2004\r\n\r\nThanks for the great seasons\r\nDue to a career change I will not be able to coach the Lady Vikings basketball team next year. First thank you to all of the parents of the student-athletes I was able to coach over the past five seasons. Your dedication to your daughters was awesome.\r\nFor the players, I have enjoyed my years at Mabton and thank everyone for the wonderful memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. I hope that you have learned as much from me as I have from you over the years. Your desire to improve yourself and to make the Mabton Lady Vikings basketball competitive was awesome to be\u00a0 a part of.\r\nThis desire was never more evident than this past week at Soap Lake Team Camp. Due to unforseeable circumstances, five girls - Diana Lopez, Alida Mendoza, Erica Sanchez, Adriana Cardenas and Talisa Sotelo showed everyone at the camp what hard work, desire and guts were all about. These young ladies played 11 basketball games in four days. They competed in every game and took most teams to the very end. It was truly an honor to coach you five Lady Vikings one last time. The future of Mabton Lady Viking basketball is alive and well.\r\nI wish all returning players and Mike Roettger the best of luck this upcoming basketball season, as well as in all of their seasons. I hope that each of you get to taste the success each of you deserve.\r\nLadies my bags are always packed.\r\n/s/ Brett Simpson, former Mabton girls basketball coach.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSeniors thank party sponsors\r\nThe Alderwood High School senior class of 2004 would like to extend a special thank you to all of the following individuals for their help in making the senior graduation party a great success:\r\nFirst to Margie Ramirez for the donation of a handmade Grizzly quilt for the raffle; Sharon Pina for being our cook and to all of the junior class parents who donated food; to John and Karen Cullen and Gary and Cori Visser for the casino (even though they didn't have any seniors this year); and to Mr. Miles, Mr. Sleater, Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Kezell for helping with the games (all greatly appreciated; to Mrs. Ohler's leadership class for the help with decorations; Mr. Mauro and Mr. Paulus and the boys for their muscles; Sandy Schilperoort for helping at the door and Bertha Soto and Sharon Rollinger for their help with decorating; and also to the school administration folks that helped out.\r\nAnd last, but not least, to all of the senior parents who were there to help plan the event and helped at the party as well. We couldn't have done without you.\r\nWe also greatly appreciate the financial and merchandise donations from the following community businesses. Without their donations we would not have had such a great party. So a great big thanks you to Valley Lanes, Judy Hall, Pepsi, The Battery Store, Randall J. Schuler DDS, MS Valley Investment Properties Real Estate Inc., R.F. Strain Insurance Inc., Alderwood Community Hospital, Alderwood Volunteer Fire Department, Harold's Repair and Rental LLC., Orange Dairy Services Inc., Yakima Valley Chiropractic Center, Ganser Enterprises Inc., Physical Therapy and Sports Rehabilitation Services, Golob Family Trust, MS Properties of WA., LLC., JCPenney, Valley Racquet and Fitness Center,\u00a0 Costco, El Conquistador, Valley Auto, Arbys, Taco Bell, Eastway Video, Burger Ranch, Wal-Mart, Homestretch Espresso, Pizza Hut, Dominos's Pizza, Slam Dunk, Electric Beach, KFC/A&W, McDonald's, Taylor'd Footwear,\u00a0 Catalina's, Jump Start Espresso, Daily Buzz, BiMart, New Image Hair Design, Martin Dental and U.S. Cellular.\r\n\u00a0If we missed anyone we are truly sorry. It took the combined efforts of everyone to make it happen and to give our kids a safe place to celebrate their enormous accomplishments for this particular part of their journey. To them we say congratulations and to you again, we say thank you.\r\nFrom the AHS Senior Class Parent Booster Club\r\n\u00a0"

Thursday night, the Grandview team played tough against East Valley, walking away with a 3-0 victory.\r\n\r\nThe Lady 'Hounds defeated the Red Devils by scores of 25-14, 25-17, 25-14. \"They played well when they needed to,\" Grandview Coach John LaFever said of his team's performance.\r\n\r\nHe said although his team wasn't on top of their game last night, they were still able to stay ahead of East Valley, which was a team that didn't bring any surprises to the court.\r\n\"East Valley was what we would have expected,\" LaFever said.\r\n\r\nThe Greyhounds played tough both offensively and defensively against the Red Devils. LaFever said junior Tonhya Wysong and freshman Kealey Johnston did a good job on defense for the team.\r\n\r\n\"Their digging has been really good and it's important,\" LaFever said.\r\nJohnston also stepped up her game, with four or five kills in a row against the Red Devils during the second game of the night.\r\nHe added that senior Valentina Solis had a good night against East Valley, noting that she did a nice job for the team.\r\n\r\nJohnson finished the night with 6 kills, 27 digs, 7 service points and 2 blocks; Wysong had 32 digs; Solis had 13 kills, 5 digs and 2 aces; Danelle Cowan had 8 kills, 8 digs, 5 service points and 3 blocks; Angie Cabrera had 3 kills and 8 digs; Mari Cornejo had 8 kills and 7 digs; Chante Bottineau had 29 assists and 12 service points; and Jessica Gonzalez had 3 service points and 1 dig.\r\n\r\nLaFever said at this point his team is in a good position going into the postseason, adding that they will likely host the first round of Districts at Grandview.\r\n\r\nHowever, before the team can look forward to Districts they have two matches left to play in the regular season. Next Tuesday night the Lady 'Hounds will play Othello at home.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Alderwood High School drop-out rates improving\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/27/2004\r\n\r\nWith all of the efforts being made to keep kids in schools, the Alderwood School District is seeing a decline in the number of students who leave school. This past year of the 1,347 students who started the 2003-04 school year at the high school, 8.6 percent dropped out.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"But that is not to say those students didn't end up deciding to continue their education further down the line,\" said Gary Vegar, the Alderwood School District's director of curriculum and learning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said the state definition of a dropout refers to those students who leave school failing to graduate with their peers. \"Many of the students will continue their education in some other fashion,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, some students will return to school at PRIDE High School, the district's alternative school, and others will elect to earn their GED, he explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I think schools are doing a better job of keeping kids in school by offering more support programs, which meet the needs of the non-traditional students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"For those who don't work well in the regular classroom, we are offering a variety of alternative education and mentoring programs to help them to succeed,\" Vegar said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alderwood figures reflect the declining state public high school dropout rate, according to figures issued from the state Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The estimated high school drop-out rate for Washington public schools students declined 6.7 percent during the 2002-03 school year, down a full percentage point from 2001-02.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, the reduction in the number of dropouts leaving school without a diploma doesn't show a higher number of in graduation rates. Vegar said that is understandable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nVegar said the state judges the drop-out rate on the total number of students who drop out of school between the ninth and 12 grades, who don't end up graduating on time within the four-year time line.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For some kids, earning that coveted high school diploma in four years is just taking longer, he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A number of factors play into the disparity. \"For example, some teens drop out to work or have babies, only to return to school several months or a year later to resume their education. One area where the percentage rates are higher for dropout rates is at the state's alternative high schools.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, PRIDE High School in Alderwood shows 45.3 percent dropout rates, based on its 2003-04 school enrollment of 158 students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here again the annual dropout rate doesn't show the number of students who may have elected to return to school to complete their education, Vegar said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In nearby Mabton School District, the dropout rate was listed at zero for the past year, while Grandview reportedly had 50 students drop out of school, using the state formula.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the OSPI figures, an estimated 65.7 percent of the state's students graduated on time in 2003, while another 10 percent remained enrolled to continue working toward their diploma.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe estimated cumulative dropout rate for the state class of 2003 was 24.3 percent. However, about half of those students termed as dropouts were students who could not be tracked after leaving school and had not yet earned a diploma.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vegar believes the actual number of students graduating is better than the state's figures. \"We just need a better way to track those students who return to earn their diplomas through other programs,\" he said.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Religious Reflections\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/27/2004\r\n\r\nDonna Homer\r\n\r\nIt is disheartening when we hear daily about more soldiers' lives lost in Iraq and of the lives of innocent people in Iraq who are killed in the conflict.\r\nIt was disheartening, I am sure, to Jesus's disciples after he was crucified. They were probably saddened that after all the good that was accomplished - to them it was over. Little did they know the impact that crucifixion and later of the resurrection would have on the world!\r\n\r\nIf we could look forward to a peaceful, self-governed Iraq and the end of terrorism, we would be somewhat comforted that the fight was worthwhile.\r\nIn Science and Health with A Key to the Scripture by Mary Baker Eddy, it states, \"The rich in spirit help the poor in one grand brotherhood, all having the same principles of the Father, and blessed is that man who seeth his brother's need and supplies it, seeking his own in another good.\"\r\n\r\nYes, advancement and peace has a price, but the price of not responding to the needs of the world has a greater price.\r\nLet us all continue to pray to know that God is in control and is directing each of us to bravely do what we can to achieve a peaceful world, where we can all live happy, fearless, productive lives each worshipping God in his own way.\r\n\r\nFor more uplifting ideas on peaceful living, I encourage you to visit www.spirituality.com.\r\n\r\n- Donna Homer of the Alderwood First Church of Christ Scientist.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Grizzlies capture first-ever Regional\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 5/17/2004\r\n\r\nCHENEY - At the beginning of the season Alderwood High School boys soccer coach Juan Pineda, who was recently named the 2004 Mid-Valley League coach of the year, said his Grizzlies planned on being one of the four best teams in the State.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Grizzlies are now just two games away from accomplishing their goal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood, which entered the postseason as the No. 3 seed out of the Mid-Valley League, took care of business this past Saturday and in the process captured the program's first-ever Regional championship.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Grizzlies defeated a determined Cheney team, the top seed out of the Greater Spokane League, 2-1 on Saturday to win the Regional crown and a top seed into the State tournament on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood will host Hanford in an opening round 3A State tournament game this Tuesday at 5 p.m. The game will be played at the Grizzly football field. The Grizzlies beat the Falcons last Tuesday 2-1 in a shootout to gain an automatic berth to State. The Grizzlies have owned Hanford the past two seasons, losing only once in five games.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda said Cheney had a very hard style to play against.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They are a good team,\" said Pineda.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda said Cheney runs a lot of overlaps. Cheney also has a style that has four defenders, which allowed the Blackhawks to attack or play defense with five players because of the set-up on the field.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The boys were able to destroy that,\" said Pineda. \"It took a while.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda strung out his forwards, forcing the Blackhawks' defense to come up. With Cheney coming out of its grouping, the Grizzlies were able to attack offensively up the middle, said Pineda.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlderwood's first goal came from Junior Martinez, who was recently named the Mid-Valley League player of the year for the second consecutive season. The Grizzly junior scored at the 15th minute off an assist from Joel Jimenez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Grizzlies' second goal was off an indirect kick taken by Kyle Van de Graaf at the 26th minute. Van de Graaf flicked the ball to Luis Galvan, who sent a header to Silvano Ramos, who sent the ball past Cheney's goalie in the one-on-one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood shut down Cheney until the 68th minute, when Blackhawk Devin Merrill scored. Pineda said the goal came off a corner kick that curved past keeper Johnny Hernandez.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Grizzlies outshot Cheney 11 to 8 on goal. Hernandez finished with four saves and Cheney keeper Josh Hooley had seven saves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda said he was very pleased with his defense in the first half.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Our defense played really well,\" said Pineda. \"We stopped a lot of their runs.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda credited Cheney with making adjustments in the second half. He said the Blackhawks dominated much of the play in the second half.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In the final 20 minutes, we had a lot of attacks on our side,\" said Pineda.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cheney broke down Alderwood's defense by using a lot of long kicks to penetrate deep into Grizzly territory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What worked well for Alderwood overall, said Pineda, was that the Grizzlies didn't try to reinvent the wheel.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were consistent,\" said Pineda. \"Nobody got out of their usual style of play. We were very disciplined about marking other players.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPineda did say he would liked to have seen his team play stronger in the second half. Pineda said the Grizzlies need to realize teams are going to make runs if they are behind and especially at this level Alderwood needs to be ready an entire game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda said it feels good to have won a Regional championship.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am really happy,\" said Pineda. \"It is a reflection of every member of our program.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pineda expects Tuesday's home game with Hanford to be an exciting one. The Falcons this past Saturday ended West Valley-Yakima's string of a decade-plus of appearances in the State tournament with a 2-0 victory to capture the No. 3 seed into State.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think they have had a lot of time to make adjustments,\" said Pineda. \"I think it will be another exciting game.\"\r\n"

        "text":"Guest Editorial\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/20/2004\r\n\r\nDON C. BRUNELL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Louisiana has 16 chronically failing public schools, 15 of which are in the city of New Orleans. After years of infighting and finger pointing, the state has finally taken a bold step to solve the problem. The state of Louisiana took over a public school. If we don't stick to our 1992 school reforms here in Washington, the same thing could happen here.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe P.A. Capdau Middle School had floundered for years. Last spring, more than half of its eighth-graders failed the LEAP test, Louisiana's version of Washington's WASL. The school's seventh-graders fared even worse, scoring lower than 81 percent of their peers nationwide on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The school has had eight principals in the last 10 years and changed its education programs three times in the past three years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn April, following years of warnings and second chances, the state took over the school and turned it over to the University of New Orleans. The University has had a plan in place since 2001 to create a charter school district of as many as ten troubled schools, but opposition from the School Board and the teachers union stopped the plan dead in its tracks. But with Capdau, the University finally got its chance to try a different approach.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The changes came swiftly. Using a $250,000 donation from a local bank, the University gave the neglected school a fresh coat of paint, repaired leaky ceilings and installed new lights to brighten its dark and dingy hallways. Next, the University hired a veteran local principal with a get-tough reputation, replaced all but one of Capdau's teachers, and implemented a new curriculum that tailors instruction to each student. The idea is to help students learn at their own pace, rather than promote them to the next grade whether or not they'd learned the material. As with Washington state's education reforms, Louisiana wants to make sure its high school diplomas are more than just a record of attendance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith the curriculum in place, the search for students and teachers began. More than 500 students applied for the 264 spaces available at the school. Students were selected by lottery from applicants who lived within a five-mile radius of the school. The grandmother of two students selected for Capdau told state and school officials that the school takeover was the answer to her prayers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Teachers were not as impressed. Applications to work at Capdau came in slowly. Soured by years of failed school reform efforts, teachers were wary of signing on to yet another experiment in education reform. Eventually, University officials overcame their concerns, and more than 60 teachers applied for 16 available teaching positions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At a training session two weeks before the start of school, teachers were warned to discard their old ideas. \r\n\r\n\"Perception is reality,\" the trainer warned, and if they expected their students to be unruly and incapable, the students would respond to those expectations. \"I want you to grab those perceptions,\" said the trainer, \"and toss them on the floor.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the teachers aren't na\u00efve; they understand the difficulty of their challenge. But they are optimistic that they and the University will be able to change the lives of hundreds of students for the better.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The school year at the new Capdau Charter School has just begun. This year, they're focusing on K-3 and the 7th and 8th grades, but eventually, Capdau will be a K-8 school. Parents, teachers and elected officials throughout Louisiana and the nation are watching closely.

        "text":"IMF loan hopes boost Argentina\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 2/12/2004\r\n\r\nHopes that the recent truce between Argentina and the International Monetary Fund would be sealed with the release of a further $3.1bn (\u00a31.7bn) loan from the Washington-based lender pushed share prices in Buenos Aires to record highs for the second trading day in a row yesterday. The IMF's executive board was expected to approve the release last night after Italy and Japan signalled last week that they had reversed their opposition to further lending.\r\n\r\nRelationships between the two sides have improved since Latin America's second largest economy pulled back from defaulting on a loan repayment to the Fund two weeks ago. The IMF's acting director, Anne Krueger, promised that the Fund would not cut off the country's last remaining financial lifeline after extracting a commitment from Buenos Aires that it will begin negotiations with private sector investors over $90bn in defaulted loans.\r\n\r\n\"Argentina has mastered the art of doing just enough to get by,\" one IMF insider told Reuters. \"I think the fact that they have, at long last, made more specific commitments to negotiate with creditors will be seen as progress. Certainly it will make it more difficult to argue that they are not negotiating in good faith,\" the source said.\r\n\r\nLast week Argentina reported growth of 8.7% in 2003. With the economy recovering strongly, investors argue the country can afford to improve on its offer to repay 25% of the face value of the bonds on which it defaulted in January 2002.\r\n"

        "text":"Obituaries\r\nDate Published to Web: 4/29/2004\r\n\r\nDEANNA JEAN BISSONETTE\r\nDeanna Jean Bissonette, 46, of Outlook fell asleep in Jesus, thereby going into paradise with the Lord Wednesday morning, April 21, 2004, after being taken to Alderwood Community Hospital a few hours earlier for acute respiratory distress.\r\nDeanna was a life-long resident of the Alderwood area. She was born May 19, 1957 in Alderwood, the daughter of Ellen (Nadine-Hand) and Verl Lint. She received her education in Alderwood and proudly graduated from Alderwood High School with the class of 1975.\r\nDeanna married Rick Bissonette, her high school sweetheart, on Feb. 8, 1976, after he returned from basic training in the U.S. Coast Guard. They were married at the Granger Assembly of God Church. While serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, they made their home in various places around the country, including Connecticut, California, Texas, Florida and Washington State.\r\nIn 1983 Deanna and Rick came home to Alderwood. They turned their love for people and animals into a thriving business (Lower Valley Pets) in Alderwood. They served the community many enjoyable years, making many friends until Deanna\u0092s sudden loss of health in mid-1999. Deanna was stricken with a severe advanced-stage cancer, so advanced they were forced to immediately sell their business.\r\nBy God\u0092s grace Deanna survived surgery and within six months was hired to work once again in retail, at Payless ShoeSource. Rick went to work part-time with the U.S. Army National Guard. Deanna continued to work in retail through the summer of 2001 until suddenly stricken again by an aggressive, advanced cancer. She became disabled at this time, but continued to live life and rejoice for each day the Lord gave her.\r\nA devoted born-again Christian, Deanna never questioned or asked \u0093why me?\u0094 She accepted the pain and increasing disability with a divine grace and peace of mind. Deanna truly had the joy and love of Jesus in her heart. It showed in the loving smile every day that she freely shared with everyone. She let her light shine right to the end.\r\nDeanna\u0092s greatest joy was worshipping, singing and praising the Lord. Her next greatest joy was spending time with her precious grandbabies. They were in her thoughts toward the last when she said: \u0093Give my grandbabies all my love, all of them\u0094.\r\nDeanna\u0092s favorite hobbies included scrapbooking (grandbaby pictures!), gardening and collecting gnome figurines.\r\nDeanna is survived by her husband, Rick Bissonette of Outlook, also a devoted born-again Christian; one son, Richard Bissonette and wife, Irma, of Alderwood, both devoted born-again Christians; two precious grandsons, Demetrio Hernandez and Elijah Hernandez; and two very precious little granddaughters, Emily Rose Bissonette (Emie-love) and Aliyah Bissonette (Leah-love). Deanna is also survived by two nephews she loved dearly and helped raise as her very own, William Lint of Outlook and Allen Lint of Yakima. She is also survived by her parents, Verl and Ellen (Nadine) Lint of Outlook; her grandmother, Hatie Mae DeWald of Yakima; three brothers, Don Lint of Alderwood, Dale Lint of Outlook and Randy Lint of Grandview; a very special person to Deanna, Elaine Getsinger (mom #2); and Carolyn Hazzard, like a loving daughter.\r\nDeanna\u0092s Christian faith was faith in action. She would want to share this final message of hope from the Word of God with everyone: \u0093Comfort one another with these Words\u0094 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18.\r\n\r\nLILY M. LUTJEMEIER\r\nLily M. Lutjemeier, 84, of Yakima died Saturday, April 24, 2004, at Heritage Grove Nursing Home in Yakima.\r\nShe was born April 21, 1923 in Larned, Kan., to Arthur and Lillie (Kitterman) Stembridge. She was a homemaker. She had lived in the Alderwood area for many years. She had resided in Yakima for the past 15 years.\r\nShe is survived by one son, Dan Lutjemeier of Curlew; and one daughter, Sandra Gillihan and husband, Mike, of Outlook.\r\nA memorial service will be announced at a later date. Valley Hills Funeral Home, Alderwood, in entrusted with arrangements.\r\n"

        "text":"Nethercutt's wife stumps for votes in Alderwood\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/25/2004\r\n\r\nOn the campaign trail for her husband, Mary Beth Nethercutt stopped in Alderwood Friday afternoon to speak to a group of women about farming, finance and women's issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nethercutt's husband, Congressmen George Nethercutt, is seeking Patty Murray's position in the U.S. Senate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nMrs. Nethercutt, said her husband is standing on his voting record that has been positive for Washington state, which includes supporting farmers and supporting the dams when the push was to remove them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He's also in favor of an energy policy,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt. \"Our current senator has voted against a common sense energy policy.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said that her husband has been able to reach across party lines and work with both Republicans and Democrats alike to accomplish things that are good for the country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can't get everything you want, but if you can get 75 or 80 percent, then that's good,\" said Nethercutt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said her husband's opponent has repeatedly voted to filibuster, which keeps debate on a topic from ending so that even a preliminary vote can't get to the Senate floor. The judges nominated by President Bush is one of the issues that hasn't been voted on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Approve or disapprove, but at least vote on it,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"George has a great voting record. He's got a great record on the issues,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, she added, a lot of bills come out of the House and are \"...buried in the graveyard of the Senate.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides stem cell research, Nethercutt said her husband is in favor of drilling in the Arctic. She said that when super-imposed over the continental United States, Alaska covers about 1/3rd of the country. She explained that when they talk about drilling they are only talking about touching 2,000 acres of 19 million acres of pristine wilderness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Until we have energy independence we are going to be held hostage at the fuel pumps,\" said Nethercutt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The South Carolina native added that her husband supported the dams in Washington state when there was a push to remove them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0George Nethercutt has also been instrumental in working with the Bush administration to develop a research facility at Washington State University that would be able to test for Mad Cow Disease, she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The next closest facility is in Iowa,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She added that her husband is also in favor of capping the amount that can be paid out for pain and suffering in lawsuits against doctors in the state. She said that Washington is losing talented physicians and it is not only the rural communities that are feeling the brunt of the shortage. At a rally in Spokane last week, she said a woman who is due to have a baby in February spoke about her needs of a obstetrician. She shared that this is her third child and third obstetrician, the others have left the state. Nethercutt said that she is hoping her doctor will still be practicing when her baby is due.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Doctors are worried about being sued,\" said Nethercutt. \"They will run more tests than their heart or mind tells them they should, and that drives up costs.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the most frustrating aspects of the election is the incumbent senator's reluctance to debate the issues. She said her husband invited Patty Murray to debate in each of the counties in the state. Murray agreed to two debates, said Mrs. Nethercutt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both were also invited to the Downtown Seattle Rotary Club for a debate, but only Nethercutt attended, because Murray said her schedule was too busy, said Mrs. Nethercutt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She added that when Nethercutt went up against Speaker of the House Tom Folley, there were nine debates. \r\n\r\nMinority Leader Tom Daschle participated in seven debates.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There must be a reason she doesn't want to talk about her voting record,\" said Mrs. Nethercutt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.\r\n"

It is one of the most important places in Alderwood. Other kids and I can go there because I can find information I need for school. I can also check out a book or video and bring it home. If there is information in an Encyclopedia I cannot check it out but I can make a copy.\r\nOther useful things the library has are computers and lessons, videos, newspapers from many places, puzzles and summer programs.\r\nIt's also a safe place. I know the library is a place I can count on.\r\n/s/ Oscar Hernandez, sixth grader, Chief Kamiakin Elementary School, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nThought of no library frightening\r\nThe Alderwood City Council has chosen to fund only half of its normal contractual amount with the Yakima County Regional Library System for the running of our local library this year, 2004.\r\nIt is now imperative that the citizens of Alderwood and all city patrons of the Alderwood library take issue with this regressive decision by the Council, and VOTE in favor of forming a library district.\r\nWith enough yes votes, the regional library system will be in charge and hopefully the many maintenance improvements to the building that have been needed for years will be accomplished.\r\nAt this writing, there are no contingency plans to keep the library open in 2005, unless this library district proposal receives a majority favorable vote on March 9 with the poll vote and the returned mail-in ballots.\r\nPlease try to visualize what a city the size of Alderwood, or in fact any city, would be without a library! It is incomprehensible and just plain frightening.\r\n/s/ Cloe Garrison, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nSecurity liaison will be missed\r\nI'm writing this on behalf of Mr. Partida, the security liaison at Harrison Middle School. Recently, Mr. Partida was transferred from Harrison to Outlook Elementary School. I would like to tell you how much of a helpful friend and adult he was to Harrison Middle School.\r\nMr. Partida is a fun person. He is like a student himself...just a little older. He is friendly with everyone. He is funny, too. He always has the best jokes. He always brightens someone's day.\r\nAlso, Mr. Partida did his job. He solved many conflicts within the school. He is someone you can turn to when you have witnessed or have been involved in an accident. He is the kind of person you can trust and know a conflict will be handled.\r\nMr. Partida will be missed very much by students and staff. We hope his time at Outlook goes well.\r\n/s/ Thailee L. Paxon, Harrison Middle School student\r\n\u00a0\r\nMust see movie\r\nI would like to strongly recommend \"The Passion of Christ.\" I went to see it and it was the best movie I have ever seen.\r\nWhen I left the theater, I was thinking\u0097hard.\r\nI hope that everyone will go and watch this movie. You will never think of Easter the same way again.\r\n/s/ Robin Seifert, Prosser\r\n\u00a0"

        "text":"Alderwood Lab breakthrough in mad cow disease\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/2/2004\r\n\r\nBoynton Lab spokesperson Laurel Sulfate told a press conference today that a team of biophysicists at Boynton Laboratories in Alderwood, Washington have developed a treatment for diseases such as Mad Cow and Kreutzfeldt-Jakob.\r\n\r\nLed by laboratory director Dr. Philip Boynton, and his chief scientists Drs.  A. VonRyker and D. Sanderson, the scientists state that by exploiting a unique quality of these so-called \"prion diseases\"--that they do not infect all species equally--a prion inhibitor has been developed that stops the progress of the disease. The treatment has successfully been given to infected cattle in Brazil, where infections have been kept quiet until now.\r\n\r\nCaused by infectious, deformed proteins called prions, illnesses such as Mad Cow Disease encompass a wide array of troubling, mysterious \"spongiform encephalopathies,\" so named because they frequently cause the brain to become riddled with holes.\r\n\r\nDr. Boynton originally characterized these diseases in 1982. He stated that mammalian cells contain prion proteins of two types: normal, cellular prions that don't cause disease; and abnormal, misshapen prions that arise from normal prions and do cause disease.\r\n\r\nPrion diseases exhibit an unusual quality--\"species asymmetry.\" For instance, while diseased mice infect hamsters well, diseased hamsters infect mice poorly. VonRyker uses a computer to simulate this asymmetry. Using hamsters and mice as one example, he claims the simulation shows that normal hamster prions, if injected into a mouse with prion disease, block the disease in the mouse.\r\n\r\nAlderwood Mayor Rex Luthor, speaking at the press conference with Sulfate, stated, \"This is truly an amazing development for Boynton. They have illustrated why they are the world-leaders in bio-technology, and we are extremely proud of their work.\"\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Alderwood police sergeant dies on elk hunting trip\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/1/2004\r\n\r\nFor the next few days the flags at city buildings will be at half mast in memory of Alderwood Police Sgt. Steve Evans. Evans, 50, died this past Saturday while hunting elk above Ellensburg. The request to lowered the flags came from Alderwood Mayor Rex Luthor.\r\nThey will remain lowered until Evans' funeral.\r\nAlderwood Police Chief Ted Mana heard the news of Evans' death about 10:30 p.m. that night. Mana said the cause of death is believed to be a heart attack.\r\n\r\nEvans recently celebrated his 27th year with the police department, where he had served as a sergeant for about four years. He also recently passed the police department's physical agility test, which tested seasoned officers on their physical fitness.\r\nAccording to Mana, Evans was hunting with some other people and was left by a hunting partner, with plans to meet up at camp later. When he didn't return they went looking for him in the area where he was last seen.\r\n\"He was found sitting on the ground where he had been left. He was just waiting for an elk to come by,\" said Mana.\r\nAt this time Mana said the department is assisting the family in whatever way possible.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be very much missed within the department,\" said Mana.\r\nEvans' death will also leave a hole in the community. Active in the town, Evans was always willing to lend a helping hand to those who needed it.\r\nIt was his kindheartedness that earned him a letter of commendation from Mana. A member of the New Zealand Parliament had written a letter to Evans, pointing out his kindness when he went out of his way to put a young New Zealander whose passport had expired and was sitting in the Alderwood jail in contact with the New Zealand consulate. The young foreigner was able to talk to his family because of what Evans had done, said Mana.\r\n\r\nHe was also a member of the Alderwood Volunteer Fire Department and, in the past, helped teach hunter safety courses.\r\nThe date of Evans' funeral service has not yet been determined.\r\n"

        "text":"Missile Silo Story\r\nStory from Alderwood High School Newspaper, originally written ca 2002\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/14/2004\r\n\r\n\r\nAlderwood these days is just another rural (very rural) community. The Mad Cow syndrome had consigned\r\nus to a bleak future.  It was in my junior year in high school that my passage into the adult world\r\ntook place. I was working part time in the afternoon at a gas station and attending school in the\r\nmorning. My friend James worked the station in the morning and attended class in the afternoon. We\r\nalso hung around with a kid named Alan that we nicknamed Squirt. Squirt was taller than either James\r\nor I, but his whole nature, well, suffice it to say he was Squirt. Squirt was a year younger than us\r\nand was, I guess, a nerd. But he was likeable, and took no offense at our ribbing. He seemed proud of\r\nhis new nickname, never having one before. Squirt was hanging out one day after school, when he asked\r\nJames and I if we had ever been inside a missile silo. Though I was a lifelong Alderwood resident, I\r\nwas only vaguely aware of the missile silo. James had lived in the town for less than two years, was\r\ncompletely unaware of the cold war legacy left by Army: an abandoned Nike missle silo in the hills.\r\nSquirt said he had a maps to the silo and had heard that we could get in there to party. We were\r\nalways looking for something new to do. James was the only one who had a girlfriend (to be truthful,\r\nthe only one who had been on a date) but this Friday she would be out of town, so it was agreed Friday\r\nnight we would go to the missile base and see if we could get inside.\r\n\r\nWe made little preparation for the trip to the silo, about a half tank of gas in my old 52 Chevy, and\r\na few candles to light our way. According to the map, the silo we were going to was about 30 miles\r\nwest of town in the hills. We thought it best to go after 10p.m. to have less chance of being seen. We\r\nalso thought secrecy was best, so no one knew what we were about to try.\r\n\r\nThe silo had not been in use for a few years and the last thing I could recall was that they had been\r\n\"salvaged\" or stripped of the equipment and valuable metals. Squirt and I had discussed the issue of\r\nbreaking in. We had agreed that we would not \"Break in\", but if it was open, as he was told, then we\r\nwould go.\r\n\r\nAbout 10p.m., James and I picked up Squirt and the three of us headed out. It was November and the\r\ndesert air was very clear and cold. The fall night sky in Washington with no moon can justifiably be\r\ncalled beautiful. A pure blackness broken only by the stars, many, many stars. It was nearly 11p.m.\r\nwhen we came to the road that turned north. A car was coming so we had to pass the road and wait\r\nseveral minutes until the car was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe road to the silo was short and we soon came to a front gate. It was locked securely, but we could\r\nsee where others had driven to the left and around the front fence. The silo was surrounded by an\r\neight-foot chain link fence with razor wire on the top. Following the rough road around the fence we\r\nfound ourselves behind a large mound of dirt, completely blocked from view of anyone passing on the\r\nroad. This was good, as I had been worried about someone seeing the car.\r\n\r\nWe got out of the car and even though there was no moon, we could see fairly well, our eyes adjusting\r\nquickly to the dark. Slowly walking around the mound of dirt we could see the back fence. There was\r\nlittle traffic on the highway with only an occasional car passing. When one did happen by, Squirt,\r\nJames, and I would get very still hoping we wouldn't be seen. After a few minutes of walking along the\r\nfence we found a breach in the chain link, where someone had cut the fence. It was large enough for us\r\nto squeeze through. If caught now, we would be trespassing at the very least.\r\n\r\nCrossing the distance to the aboveground bunker carefully to avoid various pipes and concrete that\r\ncould trip us took several more minutes, what with stopping every time a car passed. Other than the\r\nfence the bunker or entry to the silo was the only thing visible from the road. It stood about nine\r\nfeet tall, square on the end you entered, and sloping on the opposite side. It was made from concrete\r\nthat looked to be about nine inches thick. In the darkness it was only a shadow.\r\n\r\nThe door to the bunker was broken open. It had been welded shut, but someone had cut the welds. James\r\nopened the door and one by one we stepped in to the blackness. Nervously James struck a match,\r\nlighting a candle. A staircase led downward.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know about this, guys,\" I said. \"You know we're breaking the law.\"\r\n\r\nSquirt remained silent, but James was adamant. \"We've come this far,\" he said. \"No one cares that\r\nwe're here. No one knows we're here and no one will find out. Hell, they probably wouldn't care if\r\nthey knew. It's plain someone else has broken in before us, and took their time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said. \"Let's go.\"\r\n\r\nFrom where we were in the entryway we could not see how far the corridor led down. The dim light from\r\nJames' candle showed a narrow corridor leading down. After a few steps we could see a landing, but\r\nnothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nJames went first, Squirt second, and me following. James went almost gleefully down, while Squirt and\r\nI followed more slowly. James was the daredevil, always looking for excitement. I think that's why I\r\nliked him. At the landing we could see at the bottom of some more steps a wall and a right turn in the\r\ncorridor. We were obviously below ground level at this point, but just so. James led the way around\r\nseveral corners as Squirt and I lit our candles.\r\n\r\n\"Man, it stinks down here,\" said James. About that time the strong musty smell caught us. It was\r\n getting warmer, too.\r\n\r\nJames had moved into what appeared to be a small holding area with steel doors on either end. Squirt,\r\nnow our resident missile silo expert, said, \"This was a security area. One door was always locked, and\r\nthe area monitored from below, by closed circuit television.\" After that he kept up a running dialog\r\nabout the missile bases. I was skeptical that he knew what he was talking about, but I didn't know\r\nenough to challenge him on it.\r\n\r\nWe passed through several more areas on the same level before heading further down the stairs. I\r\nnoticed that the air was getting heavier, more humid, but we were getting used to the smell. The\r\nstairs were metal and were showing some rustiness. Two more flights down, we came to a large room. The\r\ncandlelight flickering past pipes, plumbing, electrical conduits, bare wires, and vents made for lots\r\nof shadows, making the ceiling, still high above us, seem perilously close. It was clear to us that\r\nflashlights would have been much better than the candles. The candles were only making the place seem\r\nmore sinister, like a crypt or mausoleum. It occurred to me that this was more like descending into\r\nthe world of the Morlocks in The Time Machine than going into a cave.\r\n\r\nThe welded-shut blast doors had been reopened by past visitors.\r\n\r\nWe took the stairs down another level, passed through a blast door and entered a tunnel made from what\r\nlooked like a corrugated drain pipe about seven or eight feet in diameter with a narrow concrete path\r\npoured in the bottom. At the end we found a closed blast door. It did not look to be welded but the\r\nlatch was closed. Turning the wheel that lifted the latch was not hard but made a horrific screeching\r\nsound in the quiet of the missile base. The sound echoed from both beyond the door and behind us. We\r\nstopped and listened for several minutes, I guess expecting someone to catch us and stop us from what\r\nnow appeared total folly. We were all shivering, but not from temperature. For my part, fear. Squirt,\r\nundoubtedly fear. James, I think, from anticipation.\r\n\r\nThis door did not move so easily. We all had to pull it, a few ear-splitting inches at a time. When we\r\nentered the next area, thinking it would be the silo, we were met by yet another blast door. It was\r\nunlatched and wide open. Beyond it all we could see was more of the awful blackness. This area also\r\nhad the metal grate, and below the grate was water. Unusual in the desert, to have water standing in\r\nan abandoned building. \"The silo must be in there,\" said James. Thinking back on it now, James\r\nsuddenly did not seem so anxious to go in, but go in he did, and Squirt and I followed.\r\n\r\nNow we were in much larger room. The ceiling was a full 30 feet up, and barely visible in the\r\nflickering candle light. The massive doors that opened to fire the missile were visible, as were the\r\nmounts for the gigantic hydraulic cylinders that opened the doors. Everything in here was huge. The\r\nfar wall was not visible. We stood there silent for a time, then moved to the left. As we walked the\r\nfloor set into a slight thrumming vibration, just from our movement. As we rounded the silo we found\r\nthe shaft for a service elevator, marked Level 2.\r\n\r\nI wanted to leave, but James and Squirt wanted to find a way to go down. With all the candles held a\r\ncertain way we could just make out a spiral staircase leading down, on the other side of the silo, on\r\nthe level just below us. The floors or \"levels\" did not extend across the silo, only extending about\r\n15 feet into the silo, and going about two-thirds of the way around. The empty space in the silo was\r\nfor a Nike Anti-Aircraft Missile.\r\n\r\n \"How do we get down to the next level, guys?\" asked James.\r\n \"I don't think we can,\" I said. \"Maybe we should leave and come back later with a ladder or\r\n something.\"\r\n \"Let's keep looking. If we can get to the staircase we can go to the bottom,\" said James.\r\n \"James, there is no way to get down there, if we jumped down to the next level we couldn't get back\r\n up,\" said Squirt.\r\n \"I agree, James, there just isn't any way.\"\r\n \"Look, if we find a way will you guys go with me?\" asked James.\r\n Confident there was no way, I said \"Sure\" and Squirt also agreed.\r\n \"Okay, let's look around,\" said James. I went back toward the elevator, James was looking at the silo\r\n wall, and Squirt was looking down near the right hand side of the blast door....\r\n\r\n <<<incomplete document>>>"

Tomorrow, Sept. 17, the local GOP leadership will instead gather at noon, in order to accomodate Congressman Doc Hastings' busy schedule.\r\nHastings is scheduled to be tomorrow's guest speaker. The public is invited to the noon luncheon meeting, to be held at Alderwood's Sunny Spot Restaurant.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth District congressman from Pasco wasted little time following this past Tuesday's primary election before challenging his Democratic opponent to a series of campaign debates. Wednesday, one of his aides personally delivered a letter to his challenger, Sandy Matheson, challenging her to contrast her views with his in a series of debates, forums and live radio call-in shows.\r\nHis proposal has raised a few eyebrows, because traditionally it's the challengers who demand debates while incumbents seek to avoid them.\r\n\r\n\"Doc feels strongly that candidates should have an opportunity to question each other directly in order to give voters the clearest possible picture of the choice before them,\" said Ellen Howe, Hastings' campaign manager.\r\nParks and rec commission\r\nto meet Sept. 22\r\n\r\nThe Alderwood Parks and Recreation Commission is scheduled to meet next Wednesday, Sept. 22, at 5:30 p.m. in the city conference room at city hall.\r\nCommission meetings are open to the public.\r\n"

The preliminary plat divides a 20.5 acre plot of land into four lots.\r\n\r\nAlthough the preliminary plat was approved, it was approved with conditions that must be met before a final plat will be approved. The conditions state that there must be individual wells to serve each lot, that the existing approach onto Yakima Valley Highway must be upgraded to commercial road approach standards and a storm water management plan will have to be submitted to Yakima County. Other conditions include such things as road width and the size of easements.\r\n"

        "text":"Selah blanks the Grizzlies\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/1/2004\r\n\r\nSELAH - It was a long night for the faithful of the Alderwood High School football team this past Friday night in Selah.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe Grizzlies were thumped by their Mid-Valley League rivals 35-0, as a fired up Selah team took care of business, said Grizzly Coach Mark Marro.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They wanted it more,\" said Marro of the Vikings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friday night's loss marks the second week in a row that the Grizzlies have been shut out. Alderwood lost 20-0 at Ellensburg the previous week.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood (2-4, 4-5) will be looking to end the 2004 season on a bright note this Thursday night, as the Grizzlies host 2A Naches.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Friday night's game against the Vikings wasn't played as badly as the final score might indicate. Going into the second half, the Vikings had a mere a 14-0 lead following a late second quarter touchdown.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the second half, the Vikings used a strong ground game to rack up three touchdowns to account for the final score. The last touchdown by the Vikings came on a 72-yard burst by Rowan Ringer late in the game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro offered few excuses for his team's performance on Friday night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We just didn't get off the ball,\" said Marro. \"They (Selah) controlled the line of scrimmage.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Grizzlies did manage to threaten inside Selah's 20-yard line a few times, said Marro, but the drives ended up self destructing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro said in the second half Selah simply was overpowering.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"They physically got after it,\" said Marro. \"We came out flat. They (Selah) just took it to us.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro said Alderwood had several players who put forth a strong individual effort, but the team chemistry wasn't flowing enough to keep up with how Selah was playing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood's Greg Gilleland nearly had a 100-yard rushing night, gaining 95 yards on 21 carries. Teammate Joe Schwartz had 25 yards on eight totes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Vikings did most of their damage on the ground, as Ringer ran for 132 yards on just 10 carries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Marro is looking to end the season strong this Thursday night at home against Naches. The Grizzlies will have an opportunity to finish .500 for the season with a win over the Rangers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They are a good team,\" said Marro. \"We are going to have to get after it.\"\r\n"

        "text":"Networking, socializing enjoyed at first Chamber after hours event\r\nStory by: Jamie Smart\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/1/2004\r\n\r\nAfter many attempts to create the perfect marketing strategy for their specialized product, Alderwood's Lloyd and Ellen Phinney have discovered two important things.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Men are the big ticket buyers in most families and most Alderwoodrs are unaware that the Knothole Gallery on Yakima Valley Highway offers one of the few places in Eastern Washington where the popular Thomas Kinkade paintings can be purchased.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those two important points were discussed during the first of a new series of Alderwood Chamber of Commerce after hours events held Tuesday night at the Phinneys' business, located next to the China Grove Restaurant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Our target demographic is men, especially those who watch golf,\" said Mrs. Phinney.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Women look at our paintings. They love them, but it is the men who come in and buy the large ticket pieces,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Women always tell me they have to ask their husbands before they can spend upwards of $1,000 per painting,\" she explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"They do buy a lot of our smaller, less expensive items,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The couple told the more than 25 people attending the Chamber event they launched a number of advertising campaigns before settling on a television advertising campaign, which is finally yielding the desired results, Mr. Phinney said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We get our best response from our spots which run closest to sporting events, like golf, and new programs, such as 'Good Morning America',\" he explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The couple said they get a lot of business from the Tri Cities and Yakima areas. \"But we continue to hear a lot of people say they were unaware we were here,\" said Mrs. Phinney.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We are happy so many of you decided to come and see us at this event,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Choosing the Knothole Gallery as its first host for the Chamber after hours event was a matter of the Chamber wanting to help promote a local business and the need to launch its new membership program, said Kathy Corliss, the Chamber's director of promotions and tourism.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Lloyd and Ellen Phinney came to us asking what they could do to make more Alderwoodrs aware that they are the Thomas Kinkade dealers in town. Asking them to host this event also fell right into our plan to reinstate the after hours program,\" she explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"I'm pleased to see so many new faces at this event,\" she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The long-time Alderwood couple originally opened their business in the Alderwood Mini- Mall, but soon found they needed a location with more curbside exposure. Their current Yakima Valley Highway location offers the couple that exposure, as well as additional room for larger displays of the Gallery's paintings and related products. Open six-days-a-week, the couple also makes use of the Internet to help advertise their business. They also make use of an extensive mailing list, said Mrs. Phinney.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We currently have 1,200 people on our mailing list, who can look forward to getting the Thomas Kinkade Gallery Christmas catalog in a few weeks, she added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to learning more about the Phinneys' gallery and the extensive line of Thomas Kinkade projects, those who attended the after hours event learned a little more about other events being planned in Alderwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood High School senior Lizeth Chiprez asked the chamber members and guests for support of her senior project. The enterprising young woman has developed a tutoring program for students preparing to take their college entrance exams.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"So many of our students need additional study with such things as vocabulary and literature in order to pass their SATs,\" she told the group.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This past summer Chiprez created a plan to offer after school tutoring to college-bound students using Heritage College students as mentors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I need your help to purchase the necessary study books,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said she has made arrangements to purchase the books, at the cost of $5 each. \"I'm hoping you will be willing to donate to this important cause,\" she explained.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We plan to serve 80 students in the first year,\" Chiprez said, adding she hopes the program will expand in the future.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This type of networking is exactly what we hoped the after hours program would encourage,\" said Tom Gaulke, president of the Chamber board of directors.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We are hoping all of those who attended this first event will be come Chamber members, if they aren't already,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next Chamber after hours program will be held at the Alderwood Worksource office in the Mid Valley Mall on Tuesday, Sept. 28. Jessie Hernandez will provided a short program on estate planning, following a tour of the state employment and training service office.\r\n"

        "text":"Lady 'Hounds third at 4A tourney\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/27/2004\r\n\r\nLAKE STEVENS - The Lady Greyhounds took their show on the road Saturday, showing several 4A schools just what the 2A Grandview team is made of.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the Lady 'Hounds played in the Lake Stevens tournament against 4A teams from Monroe, Jackson, Port Angeles, Everett and Lake Stevens. At the end of the day, the Grandview team had played 11 games in five matches, coming home with a third place finish.\r\n\r\n\"It was a pretty good day,\" said Grandview Coach John LaFever about the Lady 'Hounds performance.\r\n\r\nThe Grandview team managed to push past Monroe by scores of 25-20 and 25-13, then split against Jackson, winning 24-21, then losing 25-18. The next team the Lady 'Hounds faced was from Port Angeles, a team the Grandview girls defeated 25-12 and 25-8. The next team on Grandview's list was host Lake Stevens, a team the Lady 'Hounds beat by scores of 25-22 and 25-19. The final match of the day saw Grandview face off against Everett. The 'Hounds lost in three by scores of 12-25, 25-21 and 13-15.\r\n\r\nAlthough Grandview was going up against a group of 4A teams, LaFever said many of them are teams the Lady 'Hounds have played in the past. This is a tournament his team traditionally takes part in.\r\n\r\nLaFever said taking part in a 4A tournament like the one held in Lake Stevens this past weekend exposes his team to different styles of play.\r\n\r\n\"It's nice to get to see [the other teams] play a little different style of defense,\" LaFever said.\r\n\r\nHe added that it helps prepare his team to adapt to those different styles of play.\r\n\r\n\"They get more experience, in case we meet a team from a town that plays like that,\" LaFever said. \"We want to get as much experience as possible against different teams.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it's also nice to expose his team to different playing arenas, noting that it gives the team a chance to go to the Everett area and see where each of the teams in the tournament are from and where they play.\r\n\r\nMany of the players on the Grandview team showed that they can handle the diversity that playing larger schools brings with it. Senior Danelle Cowan racked up 32 kills, 4 aces and 16 blocks for the day, Valentina Solis had 22 kills, 9 aces and 16 blocks, Mari Cornejo had 12 kills and 8 blocks, Kealey Johnston had 13 kills, 43 digs, 6 aces and 42 service points.\r\n\r\n\"She did a really good job,\" LaFever said of Johnston.\r\n\r\nAlso helping out the team was setter Chante Bottineau with 63 assists, 5 aces and 43 service points for the day. Angie Cabrera had 3 kills and 20 digs for the Lady 'Hounds, Jessica Gonzalez had 4 services aces and 5 service points, and Tonhya Wysong had 60 digs.\r\n\r\nLaFever said freshman Christine Penwell was brought up to the varsity team during the tournament and got her first four varsity kills during the course of the day.\r\n\r\nLaFever said playing in the tournament proved to be a good experience for his team.\r\n\r\nIt was such a good experience that the Grandview team will be facing off against more 4A schools this coming weekend in the Wenatchee tournament. But before the team can head to Wenatchee they will play a league match-up against East Valley Tuesday night and against Othello Thursday night.\r\n"

        "text":"Arsenic FactSheet (Inorganic)\r\n\r\nClinical description\r\nAcute ingestion of toxic amounts of inorganic arsenic typically causes severe gastrointestinal signs and symptoms (e.g., vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea). These signs and symptoms might rapidly lead to dehydration and shock. Different clinical manifestations might follow, including dysrhythmias (prolonged QT, T-wave changes), altered mental status, and multisystem organ failure that might ultimately result in death (1-4).\r\n\r\nLaboratory criteria for diagnosis\r\n\u0095\tBiologic: A case in which elevated urinary arsenic levels (>50 \u00b5g/L for a spot or >50 \u00b5g total for a 24-hour urine) exist, as determined by commercial laboratory tests. Speciation is required in all cases where total urine arsenic is elevated to differentiate the amount of organic and inorganic arsenic. \r\n-OR- \r\n\u0095\tEnvironmental: Detection of arsenic in environmental samples above typical background levels, as determined by NIOSH or FDA. \r\n\r\nCase classification\r\n\u0095\tSuspected: A case in which a potentially exposed person is being evaluated by health-care workers or public health officials for poisoning by a particular chemical agent, but no specific credible threat exists. \r\n\u0095\tProbable: A clinically compatible case in which a high index of suspicion (credible threat or patient history regarding location and time) exists for arsenic exposure, or an epidemiologic link exists between this case and a laboratory-confirmed case. \r\n\u0095\tConfirmed: A clinically compatible case in which laboratory tests have confirmed exposure. \r\n\r\nThe case can be confirmed if laboratory testing was not performed because either a predominant amount of clinical and nonspecific laboratory evidence of a particular chemical was present or a 100% certainty of the etiology of the agent is known.\r\n\r\nAdditional resources\r\n\u0095\tFord M.

        "text":"Local Republicans hear from three judicial candidates\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/10/2004\r\n\r\nWhat should a person look for when it comes to choosing a candidate to fill an open position in Alderwood County Superior Court? This morning (Friday), three candidates for the position talked to members of the Alderwood Republican Club, noting what they feel are important things voters should keep in mind when selecting a candidate.\r\n\r\nThe three candidates for Alderwood County Superior Court judge, Scott Bruns, Blaine Gibson and Chris Tait, each took time Friday to tell local Republicans a little bit about themselves and why they hope to be elected to the judge position.\r\nThe first candidate to speak was Bruns, who announced his candidacy last April. He said the reason he decided to run for the position was because he felt in order to make a change, a person needs to be involved.\r\n\r\nBruns said since announcing his candidacy he has spent time talking to judges in the area, trying to find out what it takes to be a good judge. Bruns said in talking to different judges he found that there seems to be two kinds of judges in the system, activist judges and judges who treat both the lawyers and the litigant with respect.\r\n\r\nBruns said it's those judges who respect both the lawyers and the litigant in a case that make the litigant feel as though they have had a chance to be heard.\r\n\"They are the good judges...they believe in the system,\" Bruns said.\r\n\r\nBruns went on to talk about case loads, noting that Judge Heather Van Nuys, whose position all three candidates are seeking, has had so many affidavits of protest filed against her that she has been rendered \"almost useless.\" Bruns said he feels that simply getting someone into the system to replace Van Nuys will help alleviate case loads.\r\nGibson then took his turn speaking to members of the local Republican Club. Gibson, who was born and raised in Yakima, said he has 27 years of legal experience under his belt.\r\n\r\nDespite having so many years of service Gibson said a lot of stock should not be put on how many cases a candidate for the position has tried during the course of their career. He explained that a person can try 30, 40 or 50 automobile accident cases, but they won't learn any more than if they had tried five auto accident cases.\r\n\r\nGibson said over time he has tried a wide variety of cases and is now to the point in his career that he knows, as an attorney, how to handle complex legal matters.\r\n\"A judge needs to know how to sort all that out,\" Gibson said.\r\nHe added that his experience has also given him the ability to negotiate, which he feels is an important quality for a judge to possess.\r\n\r\nGibson then told local Republicans that if they are not sure who they are going to vote for in the race for Superior Court judge, one good way to figure it out is to talk to local lawyers. He noted that talking to lawyers is a good way to figure out who would make a good judge.\r\nGibson then pointed to a recent poll conducted by the Alderwood County Bar Association, in which Gibson was selected as the best qualified to serve as Superior Court judge.\r\n\r\nThe poll took into account candidate evaluations done by 124 Alderwood County lawyers, who judged the three candidates on legal ability, judicial temperament, integrity and relevant legal experience. Gibson came out ahead in each of the categories.\r\nThe final candidate for the position, Tait, then took his turn talking to members of the local Republican Club. He noted that although Gibson was selected as the best qualified in the local poll, only 1/3 of lawyers in the Alderwood County Bar Association took part in the survey.\r\n\r\nTait, 55, said he has been in private practice since July 1975. He said he was born in Richland, but moved to Yakima at the age of six. He also told members of the local Republican Club that he worked his way through college and law school. Tait said he worked as a garbage man in Pullman while attending college, but also held jobs as a construction worker and a farm laborer.\r\n\r\nTait said after law school he decided to come back to Yakima to start his own practice.\r\nTait said his legal experience has included a wide range of cases, everything from adoption cases to probate. He added that he has appeared in courtrooms in at least 30 of Washington's 39 counties.\r\n\"A lot of my practice has been in criminal and family law,\" Tait said.\r\nTait added that his experience would come in handy, since most of Alderwood County's backlog of cases has to do with criminal cases.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are currently three candidates for the Alderwood County Superior Court Judge position, by next week that field will be narrowed down to two after the primary election. The primary election is set to take place Tuesday, Sept. 14.\r\n"

        "text":"City gets ready to start search for new council member\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 7/6/2004\r\n\r\nPeople have approximately a week to think about throwing their hat into the ring, and trying for a seat on Alderwood City Council.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mayor Rex Luthor, it is anticipated that applications will be available at Alderwood City Hall beginning Tuesday, July 13. The applications are being made available to help find someone to fill the seat that will be vacated by Councilman Alex de la Cruz, who will be moving to Colorado Springs, Colo. Monday, de la Cruz said he will be submitting a letter of resignation to the council within the next couple of days.\r\n\r\nLuthor noted that the exact amount of time people will have to submit an application will be decided by members of the city council, but he anticipates it will be a one or two week time frame.\r\n\r\nThose who are thinking about submitting an application should keep several things in mind. Luthor explained that to serve as a city council member a person has to be a registered voter and has to have lived in the city for at least one year. Luthor said the person who is appointed to council will serve until the next election, for which the filing period is the last week in July 2005. He said the election held next fall will determine who will serve the remaining two years of de la Cruz's term, which expires Dec. 31, 2007.\r\n\r\nAs for the selection process, Luthor said the city council will go through an interview process with the final action of appointing an applicant to the vacant position taking place during a public meeting.\r\n\r\n\"The selection process will be to solicit applications, review applications, interview applicants and select a council member,\" Luthor said.\r\nHe added that he is hoping to have someone appointed to the position as soon as possible. He explained that the city has 90 days from the time of vacancy to appoint someone to the position.\r\n\r\n"

Castro was also awarded a trophy. But the ladle was her surprise award, explained Hulbert. The ladle, inscribed with Washington State Menudo Cook-off 2004, was created by Vince Castro of Wizard Graphics of Granger.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We had 10 contestants enter their recipes in our menudo contest,\" said Judy Hulburt, a Chamber spokesperson. Her husband, Carl, and Gracelia Valencia were the chairs for the cook-off, which was organized to celebrate the Yakima Valley's rich Hispanic/Mexican culture.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Menudo is a popular soup which is typically served with lemon slices, onion, oregano and avocado, which add to the flavor, explained Hulbert. Warm tortillas are also served with the uniquely Mexican dish.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Juana Ibarra of Alderwood was the first place winner in the junior cook-off division. She received a Granger Chamber of Commerce t-shirt and plaque for her award winning entry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earning second place in the adult division was Isabel Martinez of Granger, who received a $100 cash prize. Third place went to Teresa Cardenas, who received a $50 cash prize, and Teodora Delgado, also of Granger, was the fourth place winner of $25. All winners received a t-shirt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judges for Saturday's event were Guadulupe Sotelo of Radio KDNA, Granger City Councilman Ernie Guerra, Yakima County Auditor Corky Mattingly, Alderwood City Councilwoman Jennie Angel and Bernie Jaramillo of the Washington State Migrant Council.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The judges took their job very seriously,\" said Carl Hulbert.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said the judges sampled each entry twice. \"We also had four Granger School District students helping with the judging,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were very pleased with the contest and plan to do it again next year,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the contest entries, the Granger Chamber of Commerce members cooked up six pots of menudo, which they had on sale, along with 10 dozen ears of fresh corn. \"We sold out,\" said Hulbert.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said proceeds from the contest entry fees and the menudo sales will be used to held fund the city's new aquatic center.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later in the day, following the cooking contest, entertainment was held in the park for an estimated 200 people who attended the fiesta-style event. In addition, the Yakima County Auditor's office had one of its new voting machines set up in the park for demonstrations.\r\n"

        "text":"Stotz makes the shots to win Banana Belt title\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/14/2004\r\n\r\nTy Stotz's hobby is collecting birdies. Not parrots or canaries, the types you keep in a cage in your living room. Rather, he picks up his birdies on golf courses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This past weekend in the 2004 Banana Belt, Black Rock Creek's most prestigious golf tourney of the year, Stotz collected nine birdies. They helped him to soar to this year's title.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stotz, who's attending Washington State University and is scheduled to graduate this December, knocked down five birdies on Saturday enroute to posting an opening day best one-under 71. That gave him a slim one-stroke lead over Alderwood's Bob Hall heading into Sunday's final round.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The eventual winner, a 1999 Alderwood High School graduate, was still clinging to his one-stroke lead over Hall through 12 holes of play on Sunday. But when Stotz went birdie-birdie on 13 and 14, and Hall could only muster a par and double-bogey on the two holes, Stotz widened his gap over Hall from one stroke to five.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parring three of the four final holes, absorbing a double-bogey hick-up on the par-3 17th, Stotz cruised to the easy win. He finished the 36-hole affair with a one-under 143 (71-72). Hall, the runner-up, was five strokes back with a 148 (72-76).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keith Grace and Robi Raab, both playing with Stotz and Hall in Sunday's final group, tied for third low score of the tourney. They each shot five-over 149's.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nRaab, whose credentials include both Banana Belt and Yakima Valley Amateur titles, posted the third low score of the day on Saturday, a one-over 73, but he quickly fell out of contention Sunday. A triple-bogey on the 210-yard, par-3 second hole put him four shots back of Stotz. He slipped back another stroke on No. 3 when he parred the hole and Stotz birdied it. A bogey on No. 6, the toughest hole on the Alderwood course, put Raab six strokes behind Stotz. Raab played even-par from there, but the damage had already been done.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Grace, a member of Toppenish's Mt. Adams Country Club, opened this year's Banana Belt with a two-over 74. The three-shot deficit he took into Sunday's play quickly grew to five strokes, as he bogeyed and double-bogeyed the first two holes. The closest he got to Stotz was four strokes, when he birdied the par-3 12th.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall, deemed by many as the best golfer of all the current Black Rock Creek members, fell from one shot back of Stotz to three behind at just past the midway point of the opening nine on Sunday. Stotz opened the three-stroke lead by posting a par and birdie on 6 and 7 while Hall took a bogey and par, respectively. Hall rebounded to match Stotz with pars on the next three holes, then made it interesting by scoring a bird on the dogleg-right 11th hole. With Stotz taking a bogey there, all of a sudden Hall was back to being down by only one.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two linksters both parred the short, par-3 12th. But when Stotz posted back-to-back birds on 13 and 14, and Hall didn't respond accordingly, the handwriting became clear that Stotz was in control.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alderwood Christian High School senior Andrew Schutt, 18, hung with the big dogs Saturday, skating through the first 18 holes with a two-over 74. Perhaps feeling the pressure of his first ever \"adult\" tournament, Schutt faltered on Sunday, settling for an 83. His two-day total of 157 left him with the ninth best tourney score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nYakima's Wes Campbell, a seasoned veteran on many of the state's top golf courses, posted solid numbers in finishing with the fifth low score from the 60-person field. Campbell had rounds of 75-77 (152). Ivan Porcayo, another Yakima area golfer, had the sixth low two-day round (77-76-153).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Banana Belt's Rainier Flight, for golfers with handicaps of 14 and above, Alderwood's Phil Luther claimed top honors. Luther carded rounds of 84-85 (169) to best the next closest finishers by eight strokes. The runners-up were Craig Boge and Bob Hicks, each of whom had two-day totals of 177. Ken Ott and Jim Schlenker were a stroke back with identical 178's.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Golfers who cashed on the net side (actual score minus handicap) included: (Concord Flight)-1st-Ken Harle 139, 2nd-(tie) Keith Grace & Robi Raab 141, 4th-(tie) Tom Diener & Ivan Porcayo 143, 6th-Pete Veliz 144; (Rainier Flight)-1st-Bob Barker 141, 2nd-Ken Ott 142, 3rd-Dan Kolb 144, 4th-Dan Clark 147, 5th-(tie) Keith Miller & Steward Rogers 149.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flag prize winners included: (Saturday) long putt on No. 1-Bob Rice (26-2), KP on No. 3-Willie Edwards (0-6), KP on No. 4-Joe Herber (6-5), long drive on No. 7-Rick Pedee, KP on No. 9-Mike Nichols (11-4), KP on No. 11-Keith Grace (2-4), KP on No. 12-Ty Stotz, KP on No. 17-Jack Syverson (9-3); (Sunday) long drive on No. 3-Ivan Porcayo, KP on No. 5-Dennis Burke & Joe Herber (chip-ins), KP on No. 6-Chad Stotz (5-9), KP on No. 9-Robi Raab (1-0), KP on No. 12-Ivan Porcayo (4-10), KP on No. 13-Travis Davis (1-6), KP on No. 14-Dennis Burke (0-5), KP on No. 17-Ivan Porcayo (3-1).\r\n"

He questioned the $600 that will be spent in overtime pay for the police department to provide security at the event.\r\n\"Do we set a precedent when we charge for one parade and not another,\" Seeger asked his peers.\r\nAssistant City Manager/City Attorney Bruce Rinz said it is his understanding that the policy has been that the city does not charge organizers of similar events for police security.\r\nAlderwood Police Captain Bill Bank added that his department has typically absorbed the costs.\r\nThe Council, without much fanfare, went on to unanimously approve the chamber's request for assistance.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBeautification winners named\r\nThe Alderwood City Council Monday evening congratulated the latest winners of the community beautification awards.\r\nThe awards are presented on a monthly basis to homeowners and merchants recognized for maintaining an attractive exterior at their respective home or business.\r\nThe latest award winners include Juan and Martha Chavez for their home on Dennis Avenue, Bob and May Moore for their home on Olive Avenue, and the Best Western Grape Vine Inn.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAnnexation proceedings OK'd\r\nThe Alderwood City Council unanimously approved annexation initiation proceedings by a large group of residents living in the area of Saul, South Hill and Thornton roads.\r\n\u00a0The original annexation request came from four lot owners, but has since grown to include the owners of 27 lots or homes.\r\n\"This is one of the largest (annexation) petitions we've ever received,\" said Mayor Rex Luthor.\r\nThe area in question is being proposed as a \"mini ranchette\" zone.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nCouncilman seeks Black Rock signage on I-82\r\nCouncilman John Torch Monday evening formally asked city staff to look into what needs to be done to get Black Rock signage added to the exit 69 sign along I-82.\r\nThe signage, he said, would point out the exit that leads to both the proposed Black Rock Reservoir and Black Rock Creek Golf Course.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"salmonellosis FactSheet\r\n\r\nSalmonellosis is an infection with a bacteria called Salmonella. Most persons infected with Salmonella develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment. However, in some persons the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. In these patients, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. \r\nWhat sort of germ is Salmonella? \r\n\r\nThe Salmonella germ is actually a group of bacteria that can cause diarrheal illness in humans. They are microscopic living creatures that pass from the feces of people or animals, to other people or other animals. There are many different kinds of Salmonella bacteria. Salmonella serotype Typhimurium and Salmonella serotype Enteritidis are the most common in the United States. Salmonella has been known to cause illness for over 100 years. They were discovered by a American scientist named Salmon, for whom they are named. \r\nHow can Salmonella infections be diagnosed? \r\n\r\nMany different kinds of illnesses can cause diarrhea, fever, or abdominal cramps. Determining that Salmonella is the cause of the illness depends on laboratory tests that identify Salmonella in the stools of an infected person. These tests are sometimes not performed unless the laboratory is instructed specifically to look for the organism. Once Salmonella has been identified, further testing can determine its specific type, and which antibiotics could be used to treat it. \r\nHow can Salmonella infections be treated? \r\n\r\nSalmonella infections usually resolve in 5-7 days and often do not require treatment unless the patient becomes severely dehydrated or the infection spreads from the intestines. Persons with severe diarrhea may require rehydration, often with intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are not usually necessary unless the infection spreads from the intestines, then it can be treated with ampicillin, gentamicin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, or ciprofloxacin. Unfortunately, some Salmonella bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, largely as a result of the use of antibiotics to promote the growth of feed animals. \r\nAre there long term consequences to a Salmonella infection? \r\n\r\nPersons with diarrhea usually recover completely, although it may be several months before their bowel habits are entirely normal. A small number of persons who are infected with Salmonella, will go on to develop pains in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination. This is called Reiter's syndrome. It can last for months or years, and can lead to chronic arthritis which is difficult to treat. Antibiotic treatment does not make a difference in whether or not the person later develops arthritis. \r\nHow do people catch Salmonella? \r\n\r\nSalmonella live in the intestinal tracts of humans and other animals, including birds. Salmonella are usually transmitted to humans by eating foods contaminated with animal feces. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Contaminated foods are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs, but all foods, including vegetables may become contaminated. Many raw foods of animal origin are frequently contaminated, but fortunately, thorough cooking kills Salmonella. Food may also become contaminated by the unwashed hands of an infected food handler, who forgot to wash his or her hands with soap after using the bathroom. \r\n\r\nSalmonella may also be found in the feces of some pets, especially those with diarrhea, and people can become infected if they do not wash their hands after contact with these feces. Reptiles are particularly likely to harbor Salmonella and people should always wash their hands immediately after handling a reptile, even if the reptile is healthy. Adults should also be careful that children wash their hands after handling a reptile. \r\nWhat can a person do to prevent this illness? \r\n\r\nThere is no vaccine to prevent salmonellosis. Since foods of animal origin may be contaminated with Salmonella, people should not eat raw or undercooked eggs, poultry, or meat. Raw eggs may be unrecognized in some foods such as homemade hollandaise sauce, caesar and other homemade salad dressings, tiramisu, homemade ice cream, homemade mayonnaise, cookie dough, and frostings. Poultry and meat, including hamburgers, should be well-cooked, not pink in the middle. Persons also should not consume raw or unpasteurized milk or other dairy products. Produce should be thoroughly washed before consuming. \r\n\r\nCross-contamination of foods should be avoided. Uncooked meats should be keep separate from produce, cooked foods, and ready-to-eat foods. Hands, cutting boards, counters, knives, and other utensils should be washed thoroughly after handling uncooked foods. Hand should be washed before handling any food, and between handling different food items. \r\n\r\nPeople who have salmonellosis should not prepare food or pour water for others until they have been shown to no longer be carrying the Salmonella bacterium. \r\n\r\nPeople should wash their hands after contact with animal feces. Since reptiles are particularly likely to have Salmonella, everyone should immediately wash their hands after handling reptiles. Reptiles (including turtles) are not appropriate pets for small children and should not be in the same house as an infant. \r\nHow common is salmonellosis? \r\n\r\nEvery year, approximately 40,000 cases of salmonellosis are reported in the United States. Because many milder cases are not diagnosed or reported, the actual number of infections may be thity or more times greater. Salmonellosis is more common in the summer than winter. \r\nChildren are the most likely to get salmonellosis. Young children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are the most likely to have severe infections. It is estimated that approximately 600 persons die each year with acute salmonellosis. \r\nWhat else can be done to prevent salmonellosis? \r\n\r\nSome prevention steps occur everyday without you thinking about it. Pasteurization of milk and treating municipal water supplies are highly effective prevention measures that have been in place for many years. In the 1970s, small pet turtles were a common source of salmonellosis in the United States, and in 1975, the sale of small turtles was halted in this country. Improvements in farm animal hygiene, in slaughter plant practices, and in vegetable and fruit harvesting and packing operations may help prevent salmonellosis caused by contaminated foods. Better education of food industry workers in basic food safety and restaurant inspection procedures, may prevent cross-contamination and other food handling errors that can lead to outbreaks. Wider use of pasteurized egg in restaurants, hospitals, and nursing homes is an important prevention measure. In the future, irradiation or other treatments may greatly reduce contamination of raw meat. \r\nWhat is the government doing about salmonellosis? \r\n\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors the frequency of Salmonella infections in the country and assists the local and State Health Departments to investigate outbreaks and devise control measures. CDC also conducts research to better identify specific types of Salmonella. The Food and Drug Administration inspects imported foods, milk pasteurization plants, promotes better food preparation techniques in restaurants and food processing plants, and regulates the sale of turtles. The FDA also regulates the use of specific antibiotics as growth promotants in food animals. The US Department of Agriculture monitors the health of food animals, inspects egg pasteurization plants, and is responsible for the quality of slaughtered and processed meat. The US Environmental Protection Agency regulates and monitors the safety of our drinking water supplies. \r\nHow can I learn more about this and other public health problems? \r\n\r\nYou can discuss any medical concerns you may have with your doctor or other heath care provider. Your local City or County Health Department can provide more information about this and other public health problems that are occurring in your area. General information about the public health of the nation is published every week in the \"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\", by the CDC in Atlanta, GA. Epidemiologists in your local and State Health Departments are tracking a number of important public health problems, investigating special problems that arise, and helping to prevent them from occurring in the first place, or from spreading if they do occur. \r\nWhat can I do to prevent salmonellosis? \r\n \r\n \r\nCook poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly before eating. Do not eat or drink foods containing raw eggs, or raw unpasteurized milk. \t \r\nIf you are served undercooked meat, poultry or eggs in a restaurant, don't hesitate to send it back to the kitchen for further cooking. \t \r\nWash hands, kitchen work surfaces, and utensils with soap and water immediately after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry.\t \r\nBe particularly careful with foods prepared for infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. \t \r\nWash hands with soap after handling reptiles or birds, or after contact with pet feces. \t \r\nAvoid direct or even indirect contact between reptiles (turtles, iguanas, other lizards, snakes) and infants or immunocompromised persons. \t \r\nDon't work with raw poultry or meat, and an infant (e.g., feed, change diaper) at the same time. \t \r\nMother's milk is the safest food for young infants. Breast-feeding prevents salmonellosis and many other health problems. "

        "text":"Guest Editorial\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/8/2004\r\n\r\nJOHN R. DURSO\r\n\r\nThe first Monday in September has long been dedicated to the social and economic achievements of American workers. Since 1894, when President Grover Cleveland signed the bill officially declaring Labor Day a national holiday, it has been a day each year that we pause and recognize the contributions workers have made to our nation's growth and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis year, Labor Day was also a call to arms for the labor movement.\r\n\r\nIt is appropriate that our presidential elections come on the heels of Labor Day. This year's decision is crucial, a watershed moment in the history of American politics and an opportunity for our nation to stand up for the nation's working class. This is also a time for America's workers to stand up for themselves and vote into office a president that will advocate on their behalf.\r\n\r\nDuring this election season, there is much talk about George W. Bush's and John Kerry's varied positions on the war in Iraq. While there is great disagreement about foreign policy, it is right here at home that their differences are most apparent. For starters, take a look at the U.S. economy: never has the gap between the richest - those who own homes and stocks and received huge tax breaks - and the poorest Americans been more pronounced. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealthiest 20 percent of households in 1973 accounted for 44 percent of total U.S. income. Their share jumped to 50 percent in 2002, while all other income brackets fell. For the bottom fifth, the share dropped from 4.2 percent to 3.5 percent.\r\n\r\nWhile the average American is struggling to make ends meet, they are also facing an attack on the rights and protections that previous generations of workers fought for and gained in years past.\r\n\r\nEven though Labor Day was observed this past Monday, let us consider President Bush's record over the past 42 months:\r\n\r\n? Bush does not support the Employee Free Choice Act, which would allow workers to join a union, free from employer intimidation, harassment and threats. During his presidency, Bush has taken away the collective bargaining rights of 170,000 workers in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\r\n\r\n? Bush supports a privatization plan to hand over Social Security funds to Wall Street investment firms. Bush also supports making tax cuts for the wealthy permanent, which Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said may require cuts in Social Security benefits.\r\n\r\n? Bush wants to privatize 850,000 federal jobs.\r\n\r\n? Bush eliminated ergonomic regulations that protect workers.\r\n\r\n? Bush ended overtime pay protections for many workers.\r\n\r\n? Bush refused to extend unemployment insurance for jobless workers.\r\n\r\n? Bush negotiated trade deals with weaker worker protections.\r\n\r\n? Bush denied airport screeners freedom to choose a union.\r\n\r\n? Bush supported legislation to eliminate virtually all civil service protections for the Department of Defense's civilian workforce.\r\n\r\n? Bush signed a Medicare prescription drug bill that created a huge gap in coverage that could cost seniors thousands of dollars a year.\r\n\r\n? Bush opposed increasing the minimum wage and has supported allowing states to opt out of the federal minimum wage law and backed creation of a sub-minimum wage for some workers.\r\n\r\nIf that's not enough to convince you we need a change, consider this: George W. Bush is the first president in more than 70 years to watch net jobs actually decline in his term. Not since Herbert Hoover's 1929-1933 administration at the beginning of the Great Depression has a U.S. president managed such a feat!\r\n\r\nJohn Kerry, on the other hand, has spent a lifetime defending the rights of working Americans, and he has a plan to build a stronger economy and create good-paying jobs for our nation. Under his plan, our economy will create 10 million new jobs in the first four years, middle-class taxes will decrease and middle-class incomes will increase.\r\n\r\nJohn Kerry knows that our nation is stronger when we create good-paying jobs here, not when we ship them overseas. He understands that hard-working Americans - not his rich cronies - should be rewarded with tax breaks. And he understands that we can only grow our economy by strengthening our middle-class.\r\n\r\nThis past Monday Americans celebrated Labor Day. But we have one more important job - to raise our voices and vote for the candidate who will protect America's working families.\r\n\r\nJohn R. Durso is president of Local 338 of the RWDSU/UFCW, AFL-CIO, which represents more than 16,500 supermarket, dairy and health care workers in New York. It is an affiliate of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union and the 1.4 million-member United Food and Commercial Workers Union, AFL-CIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Clown classes begin in Alderwood\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/9/2004\r\n\r\nPart of the next generation of clowns attended the first of several classes last night to learn the basics and secrets of how to become a clown.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Monday night at the Alderwood Beauty Academy, Arlo Waggoner, who is also known to many as Waldo the Clown, started the class by showing the students a video by the Ringling Brother's Barnum and Bailey Clown College. The video covered the basics of what the students will be learning over the next several weeks as they delve into the clowning world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A form of entertainment that has been around for more than a thousand years, clowns were once known as court jesters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waggoner said the first step is to learn how to move like a clown.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While most people walk and move smoothly, clowns exaggerate their movements, which is important so that people know exactly how they are feeling.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although they will have time to practice later, the students also learned the basics of juggling, which includes starting out with something like a light handkerchief, which will fall slowly. Waggoner said as that becomes easier, begin trying with soft bean bags, which won't roll away if dropped.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"The bottom line is practice,\" said Waggoner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last night's video also showed the basics of balloon art, clown gags and skits and designing costumes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The students also learned there are three different kinds of clown make-up faces, the white faced clowns, which are the more reserved clowns. Auguste clowns, which have both white and flesh tones, are the roust-abouts and trouble makers, said Waggoner. The third type of clown is the tramp or character clown.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clothes are determined by what kind of clown a person chooses to be.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Waggoner said that if his students choose to be a tramp or character clown he wants them to dress nicely instead of in old rags.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key to developing a face and costume is to exaggerate already existing physical characteristics, such as height, length of face and girth.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When developing a clown face, the basic circus colors used are red, black, white and blue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clowns use color on their lower lip only and smiles are generally smaller, not the big scary smiles often created by inexperienced clowns, said Waggoner. Using baby powder, clowns set their make-up so it doesn't run.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We use plain old baby powder as long as it doesn't have cornstarch in it,\" said Waggoner, adding that they brush off excess powder with a brush.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"After I get my make-up on I can go swimming and it won't come off,\" said Waggoner.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next class will be held Monday, Nov. 15, at the Alderwood Beauty Academy. They will be going over make-up at the next class. \r\n\r\nWaggoner said it's not too late to sign up for the free classes. The class is open to all ages.\r\n"

        "text":"Alderwood High class of 2004 comes together for baccalaureate\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 6/4/2004\r\n\r\nMore than 30 graduates marched their way into the Alderwood High School auditorium Thursday night dressed in their red and black robes with their mortarboards placed stoically on top of their heads. The members of the class of 2004 were ready to celebrate their coming accomplishment, as well as recognize the role God has played in their lives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the baccalaureate ceremony the students listened as their classmates read passages from the Bible, sang together and listened as pastor of the Free Methodist Church, Mike Henry, gave the sermon. Also, Alderwood School Board member Bill Wells presented his charges for the class.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nBefore Henry started his address to the class of 2004, he congratulated them on having accomplished one of their goals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Graduating from high school is one of the important steps,\" Henry told the graduates. He noted that it is the step that leads to either getting a job or heading off to college.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I hope you go on to accomplish great things in your life,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, Henry went on to explain that accomplishments are relative, depending on how a person measures success. He explained that he had one friend in his life who finished school and decided he wanted to keep surfing, so he got a job making dentures, which gave him the time and the money to keep doing what he loved. However, he had another friend who went on to become the manager of a commercial real estate corporation in downtown Seattle. Henry told the graduates that both men had accomplished success, just in different ways.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Their motivations were very different,\" Henry said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHe said his motivation was also different, taking him down a completely different path in life. Henry told those in attendance that at the age of 13 he received God's call in his life. From that point on he knew his life would be spent serving God. This meant that in college he went on to study religion and Greek, which he said led to spending hours and hours studying.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I had that motivation and calling,\" he said. \"I was interested in learning.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, Henry said he also recognized that he would have to balance all of his studying with other, more adventurous activities. He said he went on to take up everything from mountain climbing to skiing. \r\n\r\nHenry also found himself on the rowing team, where he met two people that would ultimately inspire him. He had two teammates, one very athletic guy who ultimately died of leukemia, and another unlikely rower, who was a cowboy from Wyoming. When one teammate died of leukemia, he asked the other to try out for the Olympic rowing team. Henry said not only did the cowboy say he would try out, but then he actually did it. He made the Olympic team and went on to become a rowing coach at one of the east coast colleges.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Henry explained that it was because of a challenge God put in front of his teammate, that the unlikely rower went on to become an Olympic athlete. He said that one moment, when he promised his dying friend that he would try out for the team, ultimately changed his life.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Henry then looked to Proverbs 3, which talks about the importance of trusting in God.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As you trust God, he will show you the way,\" Henry said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told the graduates that God will help them each plan their lives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't say no to surprise challenges that God may put in your path, because it will open avenues,\" Henry said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nHenry concluded his sermon by asking God to bless all of the graduates of the class of 2004.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wells then took the podium to charge the graduates, offering them challenges and things to think about in the coming days. He charged them to create a basis of belief, to listen to the prompting of the spirit and to serve their fellow man.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The service concluded with the class of 2004 singing together, then bowing their heads to say one last prayer together.\r\n"

Previously, some players had been earning as little as $50 and were forced to take second jobs to make ends meet.\r\nSix of the weekend's eight matches ended in draws, two of them goalless.\r\nDefending champions Penarol were held 1-1 by Defensor Sporting after Martin Garcia gave them a first- half lead and Fernando Fadeuville replied early in the second half.\r\n\r\nECUADOR\r\nUruguayan Juan Ramon Silva got off to a winning start in his fourth stint as coach of Emelec as they beat Olmedo 1-0 away.\r\nArgentine Juan Manuel Azconzabel scored the winner but was sent off two minutes later as Emelec stayed fourth in the first stage with 12 points from eight games.\r\nSilva previously led the Electrics to the national championship in 1988 and the South American Libertadores Cup semi-final in 1995. He was in charge again three years ago.\r\nVeteran midfielder Alex Aguinaga scored to set leaders Liga de Quito on their way to a 2-0 win over local rivals El Nacional.\r\nFranklin Salas scored the second as Liga, the defending champions, stayed top.\r\nEccentric Colombia goalkeeper Rene Higuita helped Aucas beat Espoli 1-0 to stay one point behind in second place.\r\nHiguita repeatedly denied the Espoli forwards before Jhon Tenorio struck a late winner with a long- range shot.\r\n\r\nPERU\r\nCienciano's 100 percent record ended when they were crushed 3-0 by Universitario. Former Coventry City striker Ysrael Zuniga broke the deadlock in the 31st minute and Daniel Cicogna made it 2-0 before halftime.\r\nJuan Vargas scored another 10 minutes into the second half and Universitario cruised home despite having Edson Dominguez sent off in the 65th minute. Cienciano, who have played a game less than the leaders, dropped to fifth.\r\nAlianza Lima, Melgar and Alianza Atletico are level at the top on eleven points after all winning.\r\n\r\nCOLOMBIA\r\nAtletico Nacional beat arch-rivals Medellin 2-0 to go top of the first stage on goal difference from America, who beat Deportivo Cali 3-1 in another derby.\r\n\r\nCHILE\r\nColo Colo beat Universidad Catolica 2-1 in the Santiago derby, continuing a miserable season for their rivals. Catolica have taken six points from a possible 24 and are bottom of group three in the Apertura championship.\r\nArgentine Marcelo Espina and Francisco Huaiquipan scored in a 10-minute spell early in the second half as Colo Colo took control.\r\nArgentine Ruben Capria provided Catolica's consolation from a penalty.\r\n\r\nPARAZUELA\r\nTwo goals by Rafael Castellanos and one from Brazilian Ederley Pereira gave Charros FC a 3-0 win over El Vigia to keep them top of the championship's second stage. Castellanos went second after two goals from Daniel Delacourt gave them a 2-1 win over Trujillanos.\r\n"

Retzer, 69, of Lynnwood passed away Monday, Nov. 10, 2003, from his comforting, loving wife, Carol\u0092s arms into Jesus\u0092 outstretched, welcoming arms at their home in Lynnwood. He had suffered a debilitating stroke two years earlier, on Nov. 11, 2001.\u00a0 He was able to return home for Carol to care for him and those two years were a precious \u0093bonus time\u0094 sent directly from God.\r\nHe was born Jan. 27, 1935, at Ashley, N.D. to Gustav and Rose (Buchholz) Retzer.\u00a0 The family moved to the Yakima Valley in 1938 and settled in Granger. Cliff received his education in Granger, graduating with the Class of 1954 and continued his education at Perry Institute after serving in the U.S. Army. He was a Korean War Veteran. Cliff and Carol Rose Price were married July 22, 1960 in Alderwood. They lived in Yakima the first year and relocated to Fairbanks, Alaska, where he was associated with Interior Airways and Gene\u0092s Auto, returning to Alderwood in 1966. He was employed by Carnation Company until its closure in 1986. He then became an employee of Darigold in Seattle. He retired as foreman for Darigold in Seattle and Issaquah in 1997.\r\n\u00a0He and his Boxer dog, Lexi, took long walks daily and were well acquainted within a 10-mile radius of home. Lexi went everywhere with him in the pickup and sat right by his side in the hospital\u0092s ICU. The Retzers owned Boxers for more than 35 years, so each one was well known in the community.\u00a0 \r\nClifford is survived by his wife, Carol, of Lynnwood; one son, Clifford L. Jr. \u0093Skip\u0094 (Tina); one daughter, Stefanie (Leonard) Cox; four delightful granddaughters, Amanda, Nicole, Kelli Retzer and Gabrielle Caprice Cox; sister and brother-in-law, Ralph and Bernice Fennewald of Yakima; two brothers, Marvin (Reta) of Zillah and Melvin (Cathy) of California; three sisters-in-law, Peggy Yearout (Paul \u0093Tex\u0094) of Yakima, Frances Stephens of Spokane and Winifred Price of Seattle; and many nieces and nephews. Special long-time friends and Carol\u0092s cousins kept in constant encouraging contact with him, bolstering Cliff and Carol\u0092s spirits. He is also survived by special friends Walter and Ruth vanWyk, Jerry and Marilyn O\u0092Connor and Leon and Gail Hedrick; and cousins, Jack and Don Linderman, Ron and Gloria Judd and Harriet Berg.\r\nHe was preceded in death by his parents; mother-in-law, Lily Dixon; sisters and brother-in-laws, Ed and Ella June, Mel and Irene Fairbanks, and George and Don Dixon; two nephews, E.B. \u0093Bud\u0094 June and James Tunison; a grand-nephew, Keith June; and the beloved Lexi.\r\nCliff is remembered for his ever-present bright smile, genuinely congenial personality and the sight of him driving his faithful \u009248 Chev pickup with a Boxer dog accompanying him in the front seat.\r\nCliff loved his Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, family, friends, attending Church, visiting and enjoying good food. So we will do just that with those that care to join us attending the regular Sunday services April 25, 2004, at 10:30 a.m. at the Alderwood Presbyterian Church, 16th and Grant. Graveside services will be Sunday, April 25, 2004, at 1 p.m. at Outlook Cemetery with Rev. Katy Haney of the Alderwood Presbyterian Church officiating. We\u0092ll have some good food and enjoy each other\u0092s company at Snipes Mountain Restaurant, at 2 p.m., after the graveside service.\r\n\u00a0\r\nRENA WERKHOVEN\r\nRena Werkhoven, 92, of Alderwood and a former Mount Vernon resident passed away Monday, April 19, 2004. Our beloved mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother entered the eternal presence of her heavenly Father, and her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom she loved and was faithful to her entire life.\r\nRena was born May 19, 1911 in Boyden, Iowa, to Fred and Nellie Zylstra. On May 26, 1937 she married Andrew Werkhoven. Rena and her husband, Andrew, were dairy farmers in the Fall City and Duvall areas for many years until they moved to Mount Vernon in 1959.

        "text":"Spokane family first to participate in innovative conservation program\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/2/2004\r\n\r\nSPOKANE - Eight years ago, when Bill and Dean McLean switched from their traditional farming methods to a conservation-based approach, they believed their investment would pay off - someday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through the years, it has. They've seen erosion rates on their dry land farm reduced, soil quality improved, and their entire operation become more consistent and sustainable - even through prolonged periods of drought.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recently, that investment in conservation paid off again.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The McLeans, who farm near Coulee City, were recognized at a ceremonial signing event held in Spokane last week as Washington's first agricultural producers to participate in USDA's Conservation Security Program (CSP).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill, CSP is a voluntary program that provides financial and technical assistance to promote the conservation and improvement of soil, water, air, energy, plant and animal life, and other conservation purposes on Tribal and private working lands. The program supports ongoing stewardship of private agricultural lands by providing payments for maintaining and enhancing natural resources.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"While conservation incentive programs and technical assistance from USDA date back to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s,\" said Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) State Conservationist Gus Hughbanks, \"CSP represents the first time agricultural producers are being paid for ongoing stewardship.\" Hughbanks' agency administers the program, which is expected to be available to farmers in the Yakima Valley later this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The McLeans farm in the Moses Coulee Watershed, which was one of only 18 watersheds nationwide - and the only watershed in Washington - to be included in the program's debut-year. Of the 83 applications in the watershed, 43 met the minimum requirements for water quality and soil quality, according to the NRCS. Of the 43 qualifying applications, 13 were approved for Tier I; 26 for Tier II; and four for Tier III, Hughbanks said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Those applicants who met the minimum requirements will be participating in three different tiers reflecting both their documented historical conservation management, Hughbanks said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said farmers who sign the agreement also agree to implement additional practices to further enhance the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hughbanks said that producers would receive annual payments between $550 to $12,135 for Tier I contracts; $380 to $30,625 for Tier II contracts; and $2,366 to $35,300 for Tier III contracts. The payments are for a broad range of conservation work that protect and enhances natural resources, including water quality, soil quality and wildlife habitat.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All successful applicants have achieved high technical standards for protecting soil and water quality,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Farmers, such as the McLean family, are model conservationists who we can point to as our first line of defense in managing ecosystems like the Moses Coulee Watershed with both productivity and careful stewardship as twin goals,\" Hughbanks said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nNationally, the 2,188 farmers and ranchers who were awarded CSP contracts currently represent 1.88 million acres. Work done by the producers in the 18 selected watersheds will eventually benefit both their own watersheds and the people and resources downstream.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Announcements regarding which Washington watersheds will be selected for the program next are expected later in the year, Hughbanks said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Producers can look at the conservation activities of these successful CSP applicants now,\" he said, \"so they can ready their farms and ranches for the time when their watershed is selected.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The NRCS offers technical assistance and a \"portfolio\" of other conservation programs to help producers implement conservation activities that can help them qualify for CSP, Hughbanks said. \"The key,\" he said, \"is to begin early.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hughbanks said the McLeans represent the best of Washington's conservation community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"They, like hundreds of other Washington producers, are doing what no single program or agency is capable of doing - they are protecting the natural resources upon which all future generations of Americans depend,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is an historic time for Washington's agricultural producers, and it's a new day for conservation,\" Hughbanks said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nphoto courtesy of USDA's Conservation Security Program\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eastern Washington dry land farmers Bill and Dean McLean, who have spent the past eight years investing in conservation-based farming methods, were recently honored as Washington's first agricultural producers to participate in the USDA's Conservation Security Program.\r\n"

        "text":"Parents rally to save child care center\r\nStory by: Melissa Browning\r\nDate Published to Web: 4/23/2004\r\n\r\nParents of youngsters attending the Alderwood School District's Early Childhood Learning Center met with Ruben Carrera, executive director of school and community resources, Thursday night to discuss way to cut the child care and pre-school's budget, making it more self-sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to site manager Lydia Martinez, plans to open an early learning center began in the fall of 2000. The goal was to provide child care, first of all, to teenage mothers attending classes at Alderwood High School. School district staff members would have second dibs on the remaining spaces available in the center, which is located at the corner of Ninth Street and Lincoln Avenue.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Martinez said there are a few students who take advantage of the program, but mostly children of teachers are enrolled in the facility.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What we do is a lot more than just child care,\" said Martinez. \"We've been able to provide that child care piece as well as pre-school.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWashington Elementary School Vice Principal Diann Zavala has been researching pre-schools to see if the Alderwood School District is ready to provide pre-school instruction within the public schools. Currently, the school district offers developmental pre-school. The majority of the youths in the program are working on language development.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The goal is to serve all those children who are not being served elsewhere,\" said Zavala.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said that of the 520 kindergartners entering school this year, about 120 of them did not attend pre-school.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The plan is to have 120 spaces for those not currently being served,\" she said. The pre-school classrooms will be located in each of the elementary schools. If pre-schools in public schools are developed they will most likely begin in the 2005-06 school year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It is not our intention to close down (the early learning center),\" Carrera said to parents. \r\n\r\n\"We want to talk about the cost.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrera said he will be making a presentation to the Alderwood School Board next Tuesday night on some of the cost saving ideas the parents brought up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"When we started out we asked the board to start the program (financially) and it would pay for itself down the road and it hasn't,\" said Carrera.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its second year the early learning center borrowed $100,000. Carrera said that some of the money lost in the program has been due to state regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the regulations is that for infants the adult to child ration must be 1 to 4. Carrera said when a fifth child is enrolled an additional full-time staff person must be hired. To take care of the problem infants have been enrolled in groupings of four.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Martinez said that children will be put on a waiting list until enough are enrolled to hire another teacher.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe teachers at the early learning center are paid better and have benefits that are not available to teachers at other day cares, said Carrera.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We expect more of them and we expect them to give our children better care,\" said Carrera.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This year the early learning center is lacking $57,000 to balance the budget.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Carrera said that as a group, parents and the staff of the center need to look at ways to cut the costs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parental ideas included helping purchase materials for the class, parents providing janitorial services, a raise in tuition and seeking grants.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Concerned that the center may be closed, Outlook Elementary School teacher and a parent of a student at the early learning center Stephanie Parsons has been looking at different options to help make up the funding needed to keep the center alive.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One option she came across was the school district co-opting with the City of Alderwood or Alderwood Community Hospital, allowing employees of those two entities to use the services of the childhood center.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOne concern was that parents outside the school district wouldn't want to use the facility because it closes for the summer, but questions were raised as to the possibility of keeping the center open.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/1/2004\r\n\r\nGHS Follies\r\nOn behalf of all the students, teachers and volunteers involved in the first annual Grandview High School Follies, I would like to thank the Alderwood Daily News for the excellent coverage of our debut production that took place this past May. An incredible amount of time and work was put into our show and we appreciate the publicity of the local newspaper.\r\nWe also owe endless gratitude to all of our supporters and contributors, which are comprised of the following: Gayla Boast, Tim Bennett, Mike Closner, Kevin Bones, Laurene Contreras, Jack Dalton, GEAR-UP, Tim Grow, Martin Guillen, Arcella Hall, Shelby Hall, Mary Herrera, Tracy King, John LaFever, Andrea Martinez, Joe and Lupe Martinez, Eileen Mathews, Rick and Vicki McLean, Mid-Valley Chrysler, Genoveva Morales-Ledesma, Movie Gallery, Kenny and Joci Nelson, Pizza Hut, Elizabeth Ray, Christy Rodriguez, Safeway, Travel Connection, University of Washington, WSU-Tri Cities Latino Outreach, and the judges\u0097Mike Carpenter, Dottie and Sil Cervantes, Gretchen Chronis, Dirk Desserault, and Karen and Joe Veloz.\r\nThank you, parents and community members, for attending our Follies production. Our tremendously talented group of students who participated in the production should be very proud. Because of extraordinary support we received, we surpassed our monetary goal by 50 percent.\r\n/s/ Danika Martinez, GHS class of 2007 president\r\n\u00a0\r\nPublic encouraged to get involved with 4th of July celebration here\r\nI am an active citizen who enjoys participating in local activities, as well as getting others involved in doing the same. I recently helped coordinate a fund-raiser for the Fourth of July celebration. We had donation jars at businesses all around town, asking for money to help pay for the public fireworks display at the Alderwood High School football field. This display is free to the public.\r\nThis was a success, however, we need to start planning for next year. Our fireworks display could be a lot bigger if we all pitched in and helped fund this project. We need to turn in funds for this project by June 1, 2005.\r\nOur proposal is you, the public and the citizens of Alderwood, help fund this project by donating all your aluminum cans. If everyone donated their cans we could raise enough money to have a spectacular one-hour show for the 2005 Fourth of July display. We know that if we all work together we can accomplish anything.\r\nI spoke with Dave's Recycling Center in Grandview and I have opened an account for this project. If you recycle your items at this location and would like to donate all or part of your profits for this project, just let them know at the counter and they will take your donation and deposit it into the \"Citizens of Alderwood Fund.\"\r\nWe will furnish the containers for the aluminum cans, as well as monitor them and pick them up as often as needed. Currently, we have secured one site at the law and justice center, on First Street, near the recycling dumpsters. We are presently trying to secure more sites where citizens can drop off their aluminum can donations around town.\r\nWe need your help. Won't you please help by providing a container site? Won't you please help by donating your aluminum cans and drop them off at the designated site near the law and justice center? Won't you please help by donating some or all of your recycling profits at Dave's Recycling Center? Won't you please help by hosting a donation jar at your business to raise funds for next year's fireworks display?\r\nIf you are able to help with this worthwhile community project we would greatly appreciate your support. Please contact me at 837-6340.\r\n/s/ Carol Stone, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nCasino night\r\nIt's a shame more people didn't show up for the casino night on Friday, Aug. 13, at the Alderwood Senior Center. The ones who came certainly enjoyed the evening.\r\nWhen we entered the center we were given $200 in play money. The kitchen counter was filled with all sorts of goodies, including delicious sandwiches. After eating we chose games we wished to play to earn more money so at the end of the evening we'd have enough play money to bid on items offered in the auction.\r\nAll in all, it was a fun evening for all us seniors.\r\nThe emcee, Don Stiles, makes us all laugh and he did a great job as usual. All of us send a great big thank you to those who helped make casino night possible for all of us. Also, thanks to the young man who carried out my winnings to the car in the dark.\r\nWe had a wonderful evening.\r\n/s/ Bernice Seward, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nFairs threatened\r\nThe Yakima Valley Fair & Rodeo in Grandview recently concluded another delightful year, with dedicated kids entering food, craft, clothing and livestock exhibits\u0097all while figuring out ways to stay cool.\r\nAnd it would be a shame to lose this fair, disappointing a lot of kids and parents who count on participating every year. Grandview's fair is just one of three community fairs held annually in the Yakima Valley, besides Toppenish's and West Valley's.\r\nHow are these fairs threatened? Because the county budget of $390,000 for Yakima County WSU Extension's match is in jeopardy. While about 80 percent of the county's nearly $55 million budget for law and justice is essential in keeping our communities safe, it is also essential to keep the positive impacts that Extension brings to the residents of Yakima County.\r\n4-H is based in the Extension Service. If Extension was eliminated, the 4-H program in Yakima County would be eliminated. Hundreds of youth in 4-H and FFA participate in county fairs, yet 4-Hers participate about 10 to 1 over those in FFA\u0097which means the fairs would probably collapse due to lack of participation. This is exactly what happened in Multnomah County in Oregon.\r\n4-H is just a tip of the iceberg of the benefits of Extension. Extension agents in horticulture and livestock advance those industries with information in cutting edge technology and research. Agriculture is a foundation of Yakima County. The Extension Service is exemplary in using volunteers to improve lifestyles of residents by teaching food safety, improved nutrition, sewing, gardening and living on a budget, to name a few.\r\n$390,000 is a small portion, creating a huge positive impact, of the $55 million county budget. Yakima County receives approximately two times the match in resources for its investment in WSU Extension. If the money is not approved for Extension, it will be sorely missed, and cause a \"trickle down\" effect with a loss of valuable industry information, household education and community fairs in Toppenish, West Valley and Grandview.\r\n/s/ Karin Argo, Zillah\r\n\u00a0\r\nVote for righteousness\r\nYes Bob (Story), you are correct, when you said, \"who do we vote for?\"\r\nRegarding the U.S. Senate, I would like to share the following: the Bible says, \"righteousness exalts a nation.\" Here is our chance to vote for righteousness (www.bradklippert.com). Be sure to click on the link \"Sound the Alarm.\"\r\nThis man's brochure and web site make no bones about his Godly stance. It states, \"a God-fearing, Bible-believing, Ten Commandments-honoring evangelical Christian.\"\r\nOh, that God fearing people would vote their conscience.\r\n/s/ Barbara Mortensen, Alderwood\r\n\u00a0\r\nSoftball tourney\r\nWhat a great weekend we had in Alderwood, with a 20-team softball tournament at SunnyView Park.\r\nFor those who think SunnyView's ball fields don't get used, you are very wrong. With 15 of the 20 teams being from out of town, just imagine what kind of revenue Alderwood generated. Players and their families stayed overnight and ate at various restaurants, or shopped at local stores.\r\nFifteen teams times 14 players per team, plus families, makes for a lot of money spent in town.\r\nI, myself, spent the $2,200 for tournament expenses here locally.\r\nI want to thank the city park staff for its excellent work all week to prepare the fields for use. We had quite a few compliments. Also, I want to thank our sponsors: Aztlan Sportswear, El Valle Restaurant and The Valley's Market. Thanks also to Linda, Jaime, Bobby Jr., Jessica, Andre and Bobby III Sarmiento, and Rene and Yolanda Montelongo, for all their hard work. Without everyone's help this success wouldn't have taken place.\r\n/s/ Bob Sarmiento Sr.\r\n\u00a0\r\nGuard rail efforts\r\nI want to especially thank one individual who has taken on several projects and volunteered all her time and effort. Carol Stone has done an excellent job in organizing the plantings along the guard rail. Carol organized all of the volunteers to plant the hundreds of bulbs and starts in this area in Alderwood. She donated most of the items and received donations for the rest.\r\nAfter this project was completed Carol then came to me with a new idea to paint the guard rail and have multi-color handprints decorate the guard rail. Again, she organized this effort and did a great job. Thanks to Carol this area is much brighter and more colorful for all of us to enjoy.\r\nIt is good to know that we can count on individuals to volunteer their time and energy to make our community a better place to live.\r\n/s/ Don Stiles, Director, Alderwood Parks and Recreation Department\r\n\u00a0"

She received her education in Wapato and graduated with the class of 1930.\u00a0 Following her education she went to work for the Wapato newspaper and later for Washington Fruit in Yakima.\u00a0 On April 12, 1942 she married Lawson Murphy in Yakima. They lived in Yakima, and later moved to Portland, Ore., where she worked as a welder in the shipyards.\u00a0 She returned to the Yakima Valley and made her home in Mabton and Grandview before moving to Prosser in the early 1980\u0092s, where she made her home until the time of her death.\u00a0 \r\nShe is survived by one daughter, Mary June and husband, Richard, of Prosser; step-daughter, June Dettbarn of Portland, Ore.; three grandchildren; three step-children; and five great-grandchildren.\r\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; her husband, Lawson Murphy; one brother; and two sisters.\r\n\u00a0Memorial services will be held Friday, May 14, 2004, at 11 a.m. at Grandview Church of the Nazarene.\u00a0 Wells Funeral Home, Grandview, is in charge of arrangements.\r\n\u00a0\r\nPATTY CLARICE MORROW\r\nPatty Clarice Morrow, 90, a Alderwood resident since 1936, beloved wife, mother and grandmother, passed away Thursday, May 6, 2004, at Sun Terrace in Alderwood.\r\nPat was born Oct. 16, 1913 in Bloomfield, Mo. to Jefferson and Hallie Hutchings. She graduated from Yakima High School in 1930 after advancing a grade.\r\nOn July 19, 1936 Patty C. Hutchings married Paul O. Morrow in Yakima. They celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary in July 2003. She was a homemaker for much of her married life. Pat worked along side her husband helping operate Alderwood Tent & Awning, then on Yakima Valley Highway, from 1959 until they sold the business and retired in 1976.\r\nPat enjoyed the family camping and fishing trips, especially those that included the three grandsons. Her sense of humor sparked those family gatherings, where she was among the first to laugh and enjoy stories and games. She was an avid gardener, and the resulting roses and other flowers were a familiar sight for 22 years at the Morrow\u0092s home along Northwest Crescent. Summer was a busy time in the kitchen, where she preserved what Paul grew in the vegetable garden. Pat was an accomplished seamstress. She spent years of leisure time crocheting afghans for family members. Every time we snuggle under one of your creations, Mother and Grandma, we will feel the love that went into it. Pat and Paul were both enthusiastic supporters of Alderwood High School athletics and rarely missed a football or basketball game.\r\nPat was a member of Alderwood United Methodist Church, where she played an active roll in the United Methodist Women and on church committees. She served as UMW treasurer and as a church financial secretary for 30 years.\r\n\u00a0 She is survived by her husband, Paul of Alderwood; and two daughters, Barbara Galbraith and husband, Jim, of Alderwood and Janet Thompson and husband, Marty, of Santa Rosa, Calif. Also surviving are her sister, Daisy Dent of Mesa, Ariz.; three grandsons, Chris Thompson of Windsor, Calif., Sean Thompson of Forest Hills, N.Y. and Craig Galbraith and wife, Melissa, of Yakima.\r\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, and two sisters, Cleo Hutchings and Clara Groenig.\r\nBurial will be held Friday, May 14, 2004 at 10:30 a.m. at Lower Valley Memorial Gardens, followed by a memorial service at 11:30 a.m. at Alderwood United Methodist Church. Those wishing to honor Pat\u0092s memory may contribute to Alderwood United Methodist Church or Memorial Home Care Services (Hospice). Wells Funeral Home is in charge of arrangements.\r\n"

        "text":"AHS principal talks about course changes\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 4/1/2004\r\n\r\nAlderwood High School Principal Dennis Birr went before the school board last week to talk about some changes with the 2004-05 course description book.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beginning with the class of 2006, graduating seniors will need only 22 credits. The class of 2005 will still need 24 credits to receive a diploma, said Birr.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Birr also touched on the non-credit graduation requirements of high school students. Students are required to submit a five-year education plan upon entering high school. Freshmen will not get their class agendas until the plan is submitted. The senior project will become a requirement of all high school students beginning with the class of 2006. The class of 2005 will not be required to do a senior project as it is part of their assignment for their contemporary world problems course. Birr told the school board that starting with the class of 2006 even the Running Start students attending Yakima Valley Community College will have to complete a senior project. Currently, Running Start students aren't required to complete a senior project.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Birr also touched on the name change for the Certificate of Mastery the incoming freshman class will have to obtain to receive a high school diploma. Birr said the certificate is now known as the Certificate of Academic Achievement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under course requirements at the high school, students will have to have four credits of English, two credits of health/fitness, two credits of science, one credit of visual and performing arts and one credit of occupational/career and technical courses. Students will need to take one credit of world history, one credit of American history and one credit of contemporary world problems. Birr also told of how students can satisfy their half-credit for Pacific Northwest history by taking the course in the seventh grade instead of high school. High school students also need to take three credits of math or two credits of math if courses include algebra I or geometry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About the only major change in next year's high school course description book is under visual and performing arts. This class section used to be defined as fine arts. The new name eliminates some of the courses that fell under the fine arts program, such as debate. Classes that fall under the visual and performing arts include art, music, desktop publishing and commercial art/animation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Birr said next year's course description book is relatively the same as the previous year. He also noted the high school will be adding advanced placement biology next year. The high school now has nine advanced placement courses. The high school will become eligible for a special designation from colleges once it has 10 advanced placement classes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.

Friday, July 30, John Panni withdrew his name from the running.\r\nThis past Wednesday afternoon, Panni had no comment on why he decided to withdraw from consideration for the city council position.\r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to Alderwood Mayor Rex Luthor and members of the Alderwood City Council, Panni wrote: \"I saw the opportunity to serve on the Alderwood City Council here recently as a chance to fulfill my personal objectives. But, there are jobs where one can't cross their personal and professional life and I have one of those.\"\r\n\r\nPanni, who works as a reporter for the Alderwood Daily News in Alderwood, wrote that he has a lot of respect for city council and what each member goes through, adding that he also has a lot of respect for the \"...integrity of the journalism industry.\"\r\n\"Personally, I would love to serve the community on the Alderwood City Council, but I can't wear two hats,\" Panni wrote. \"And I happen to like the one I wear now as a journalist for our wonderful community.\"\r\n\r\nLuthor said of Panni's withdrawal that he appreciates his desire to serve his community.\r\n\"He had determined that elected office will not work for him at this time, but I am confident that he will find other ways to assist this community,\" Luthor said.\r\nThe remaining candidates for the position are Bruce Epps Theresa Hancock, Wade Drysdale, Ermenejildo Rodriguez, Raul Martinez and Carol Stone.\r\n\r\nAlderwood City Council will interview each of the remaining candidates during a special session set to take place Aug. 16 in the council chambers. Following the public meeting, council members will go into executive session to discuss their decision.\r\n\r\nThe candidate selected to fill the position will then have to seek election to the office next year to finish out the remainder of de la Cruz's four-year term.\r\n"

Quilts designed by featured artist Kate Carroll of Anaconda, Mont. will be displayed at the show, as well.\r\nVisitors to Leavenworth will find numerous quilts displayed throughout the community those six days. There is no fee to take in the beauty of the quilt-making.\r\nA grand showing, though, is scheduled for Sept. 10-12, and admission is set at $5.\r\nQuilting workshops will also be offered Sept. 10-12.\r\nFor more information about this year's show, go on-line to: www.quiltersheaven.com.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBaket-making class Sept. 18\r\nPATERSON - Columbia Crest Winery will host a basket-making class Saturday, Sept. 18, from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\nProsser artist and gallery owner Nanette Stark will demonstrate to those in the class how to create a hand-woven twill wool drying basket. An heirloom-quality basket, it is designed to be sturdy and useful for many tasks or decorative uses.\r\nThe $38 class fee includes all weaving materials. Participants should bring to the session a tape measure, a sturdy pair of scissors, an awl, 20 clothespins and a sharp pocket knife. Students are also invited to bring a picnic lunch for the hour-long lunch break.

He was the first to present Brazilian music in the English language, and through collaborations with Burt Bacharach, the Beatles, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman brought the Brazilian bossa nova/samba sound to pop culture.\r\nAfter getting signed to A&M records by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, Mendes and his band toured with Alpert's Tijuana Brass, making him a household name in the U.S. and Europe.\r\nAlthough he brought Brazilian sound to the mainstream, his desire to return to his roots led him to form the band \"Brazil '77.\" Recording Primal Roots, a fresh tribute to indigenous Brazilian music that was critically hailed, it was commercially ignored. But, his effort laid the foundation for other musicians, such as Gloria Estafan and Linda Ronstadt, to cut albums in their native tongues.\r\nMendes continued to pen hits throughout the 1980's, including Never Gonna Let You Go.\r\nThe band members that will be appearing with Mendes at Dimitrious's Jazz Alley Sept. 16-19 include Jessica Taylor and Dawn Bishop (vocals), Bill Brendle (keyboards), Leonardo Nobre (bass), Mike Shapiro (drums), Kleber Pimenta (guitar), Nailton Dos Santos (percussion) and Marco Dos Santos (percussion).\r\nSet times Thursday through Saturday will be at 8 and 10:15 p.m., and at 6:30 and 8:45 p.m. on Sunday. Reservations for one of the shows can be made by calling (206) 441-9729.\r\n\u00a0\r\nCask beer festival on tap for Oct. 30\r\nSEATTLE - The fifth annual Washington Cask Beer Festival, a major highlight of the Seattle beer fest scene, will be held Saturday, Oct. 30.\r\nThe event will feature many one-of-a-kind handcrafted, cask-conditioned beers from more than 30 of the region's most innovative microbreweries.\r\nProviding food at the event will be Barking Dog Alehouse.\r\nThis year's festival will include two sessions\u0097the first from noon to 4 p.m., the second from 6 to 10 p.m. Separate tickets are required for each session.\r\nAdvance tickets, priced at $35, are available on-line at: www.washingtonbrewfest.com.\r\nOnly 250 tickets are available for each session.

        "text":"Botulism FactSheet\r\n\r\nBotulism is a muscle-paralyzing disease caused by a toxin made by a bacterium called Clostridium botulinum. \r\n\r\nThere are three main kinds of botulism:\r\n\u0095\tFoodborne botulism occurs when a person ingests pre-formed toxin that leads to illness within a few hours to days. Foodborne botulism is a public health emergency because the contaminated food may still be available to other persons besides the patient.\r\n\u0095\tInfant botulism occurs in a small number of susceptible infants each year who harbor C. botulinum in their intestinal tract.\r\n\u0095\tWound botulism occurs when wounds are infected with C. botulinum that secretes the toxin. \r\n\r\nWith foodborne botulism, symptoms begin within 6 hours to 2 weeks (most commonly between 12 and 36 hours) after eating toxin-containing food. Symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, muscle weakness that always descends through the body: first shoulders are affected, then upper arms, lower arms, thighs, calves, etc. Paralysis of breathing muscles can cause a person to stop breathing and die, unless assistance with breathing (mechanical ventilation) is provided.\r\n\r\nBotulism is not spread from one person to another. Foodborne botulism can occur in all age groups.\r\n\r\nA supply of antitoxin against botulism is maintained by CDC. The antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms if administered early in the course of the disease. Most patients eventually recover after weeks to months of supportive care. \r\n \r\n"

        "text":"Update given on new middle school, concession stand\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/6/2004\r\n\r\nAlderwood School District Executive Director of Business Dave Plesha provided the school board last week with a report on the progress being made at the new middle school. Plesha also updated the board on how the reconstruction of the concession stand at the high school is going.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plesha told board members he has been meeting with city and county officials on issues concerning the new middle school that will be constructed on 57 acres of land along Washout Road, just north of Alderwood Christian High School. Plesha has been discussing issues concerning water and sewer lines and the entry way to the new school with City of Alderwood and Yakima County officials. Currently, the property for the new middle school is outside the city limits, creating some issues with access to water/sewer lines. The school district is looking at hopefully being able to annex the property into the city at a future date. School board member Fred Kilian offered his assistance to Plesha in conducting talks with the Alderwood Valley Irrigation District on what to do with the irrigation canal that runs nearby.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In related news to the middle school construction project, school board members approved two resolutions that will assist the district in obtaining reimbursement money from the state. The first of the resolutions approved has Alderwood School District Superintendent Dr. Aaron Bones and Plesha serving as the authorizing agents for school facilities. The other resolution had to do with assuring the state that no racial imbalance would exist in the school district with the construction of a new middle school.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plesha also provided the board with an update on the rebuilding of the concession stand at the high school football field. The reconstruction of the concession stand is being done in-house by school district staff. The new concession stand will be much larger than the old one, said Plesha. Some of the highlights with the new concession stand, said Plesha, will be additional toilets in the women's restroom and the facility will be equipped with heaters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Kerry concedes Presidential race Tuesday morning\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/3/2004\r\n\r\nIt looked as if the country was heading for a repeat of the 2000 Presidential election, but there will be no exhilarating counting of the chads or Supreme Court battles this time around.\r\n\r\nPresident George W. Bush won a second term this morning when Democratic challenger John Kerry called the Texas Republican just after 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time to concede the 2004 election, according to a report from the Associated Press.\r\n\r\nVoters across the country went to bed last night without knowing who would be the next president of the United States. As of last night, the outcome of the Presidential election looked as if it would hinge on the outcome of Kerry challenging the election results in Ohio. Many political consultants last night were guessing Kerry would challenge the results of the Ohio election, demanding that the estimated 140,000 to 200,000 provisional ballots cast be counted. As of this morning, President Bush had 50.96 percent, or 2,783,655 votes, in Ohio, while Kerry had 2,653,005 votes, or 48.57 percent of all ballots cast.\r\n\r\nMany of the election problems in Ohio had to do with the number of new voters registered for the 2004 election, which numbered more than one million residents, according to the Ohio secretary of state.\r\n\r\nIt can be surmised that Kerry probably conceded the 2004 election because many political figures felt that even if the provisional ballots were counted in Ohio, Kerry couldn't make-up the difference he trailed by.\r\n\r\nKerry and his vice presidential running mate John Edwards did quite well in Washington, winning the state's 11 electoral votes. Kerry nabbed 52.5 percent of the vote in Washington.\r\n\r\nPresident Bush won Alderwood County, a heavily Republican area, with 28,663 votes, compared to the 19,220 ballots cast for Kerry. The President was also a huge winner in neighboring Benton County, where he garnered 31,611 votes to Kerry's 15,432. Much like 2000 Presidential candidate Al Gore, Kerry won the state of Washington thanks in large part to election results in King County. Kerry had 347,025 votes in the Seattle area compared to 182,011 for the Bush/Dick Cheney ticket.\r\n\r\nIndependent candidate Ralph Nader received 13,729 votes in Washington state.\r\n\r\nBush was able to secure a second term in the White House thanks in part to winning the state of Florida. A large Latino turnout in that state supported the President.\r\n"

Crop experts with the state say that's because we had a particularly warm April.\r\nAt Hilda Dorfman's farm, roses, daisies, and geraniums framing her long dirt road all blossomed ahead of schedule.\r\nThe former professor of Ecological Studies at Washington State University won't say global warming is to blame, but she will say we need to pay attention to when crops come early.\r\n\"Certainly I think it's a cumulative thing and here's one more piece in the puzzle, or one more sign along the way that we're seeing some concrete evidence that we're heating up,\" she said. \r\nIn the meantime, Varley says sales are slow because customers simply don't expect asparagus this early. \r\n\"Wait for three or four days when people finally believe that, hey, we've got the asparagus here. Then we'll go through a lot of asparagus,\" he predicted.\r\n"

The AUC_supported by economic elites, drug traffickers, and local communities lacking effective government security_claims its primary objective is to protect its sponsors from insurgents. The AUC now asserts itself as a regional and national counterinsurgent force. It is adequately equipped and armed and reportedly pays its members a monthly salary. AUC political leader Carlos Casta\u00f1o has claimed 70 percent of the AUC's operational costs are financed with drug-related earnings, the rest from \"donations\" from its sponsors.\r\nActivities \r\nAUC operations vary from assassinating suspected insurgent supporters to engaging guerrilla combat units. Colombian National Combat operations generally consist of raids and ambushes directed against suspected insurgents. The AUC generally avoids engagements with government security forces and actions against US personnel or interests.\r\nStrength \r\nEstimated 6000 to 8150, including former military and insurgent personnel.\r\nLocation/Areas of Operation \r\nAUC forces are strongest in the northwest in Antioquia, C\u00f3rdoba, Sucre, and Bol\u00edvar Departments. Since 1999, the group demonstrated a growing presence in other northern and southwestern departments. Clashes between the AUC and the FARC insurgents in Putumayo in 2000 demonstrated the range of the AUC to contest insurgents throughout Colombia.\r\nExternal Aid \r\nNone.\r\n\r\nNational Liberation Army (ELN)\u0097Colombia\r\nDescription\r\nMarxist insurgent group formed in 1965 by urban intellectuals inspired by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Began a dialogue with Colombian officials in 1999 following a campaign of mass kidnappings\u0097each involving at least one US citizen\u0097to demonstrate its strength and continuing viability and force the Pastrana administration to negotiate. Peace talks between Bogot\u00e1 and the ELN, started in 1999, continued sporadically through 2001 until Bogota broke them off in August, but resumed in Havana, Cuba, by year's end. \r\nActivities\r\nKidnapping, hijacking, bombing, extortion, and guerrilla war. Modest conventional military capability. Annually conducts hundreds of kidnappings for ransom, often targeting foreign employees of large corporations, especially in the petroleum industry. Frequently assaults energy infrastructure and has inflicted major damage on pipelines and the electric distribution network.\r\nStrength\r\nApproximately 3,000-5,000 armed combatants and an unknown number of active supporters.\r\nLocation/Area of Operation\r\nMostly in rural and mountainous areas of north, northeast, and southwest Colombia, and Venezuela border regions.\r\nExternal Aid\r\nCuba provides some medical care and political consultation.\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)\r\nDescription\r\nEstablished in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, the FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable, and best-equipped Marxist insurgency. The FARC is governed by a secretariat, led by septuagenarian Manuel Marulanda, a.k.a. \"Tirofijo,\" and six others, including senior military commander Jorge Briceno, a.k.a. \"Mono Jojoy.\" Organized along military lines and includes several urban fronts. In 2001, the group continued a slow-moving peace negotiation process with the Pastrana Administration that has gained the group several concessions, including a demilitarized zone used as a venue for negotiations. \r\nActivities\r\nBombings, murder, kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, as well as guerrilla and conventional military action against Colombian political, military, and economic targets. In March 1999 the FARC executed three US Indian rights activists on Venezuelan territory after it kidnapped them in Colombia. Foreign citizens often are targets of FARC kidnapping for ransom. Has well-documented ties to narcotics traffickers, principally through the provision of armed protection.\r\nStrength\r\nApproximately 9,000-12,000 armed combatants and an unknown number of supporters, mostly in rural areas.\r\nLocation/Area of Operation\r\nColombia with some activities\u0097extortion, kidnapping, logistics, and R&R\u0097in Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador.\r\nExternal Aid\r\nCuba provides some medical care and political consultation.\r\n\r\nPorvenir Luminoso (Shining Future, or SF) \r\nDescription\r\nFormer farm worker Francisco Dorado formed Porvenir Luminoso in the late 1980s, and his teachings created the foundation of SF's militant reformist doctrine. His work is being carried on by the charismatic Armando Catalano, the new leader of SF in the 2000s. In the 1990s PL became a formidable force in  South America; although Parazuelan military blame them for the deaths of 5000 persons since Shining Future took up arms. Its stated goal is to destroy existing Parazuelan institutions and replace them with a neo-marxist peasant revolutionary regime. It also opposes any influence by foreign governments, as well as by other Latin American guerrilla groups, especially the Xiaan Compacto Revolutionary Movement (MRCX). In 2002, the Parazuelan National Police thwarted an SF attack against \"an American objective\", possibly the US Embassy, when they arrested two SF cell members. \r\nActivities \r\nConducted indiscriminate bombing campaigns and selective assassinations. Detonated explosives at diplomatic missions of several countries in Parazuela in 1990, including an attempt to car bomb the US Embassy in December. Parazuela authorities continued operations against the SF in 2003 in the countryside, where the SL conducted operations. \r\nStrength \r\nMembership is unknown but estimated to be 200 armed militants. SL's strength has been vastly diminished by arrests and desertions.\r\nLocation/Area of Operation \r\nParazuela, with most activity in rural areas. \r\nExternal Aid \r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) \r\nDescription\r\nTraditional Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movement formed in 1983 from remnants of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, a Peruvian insurgent group active in the 1960s. Aims to establish a Marxist regime and to rid Peru of all imperialist elements (primarily US and Japanese influence). Peru's counterterrorist program has diminished the group's ability to carry out terrorist attacks, and the MRTA has suffered from infighting, the imprisonment or deaths of senior leaders, and loss of leftist support. In 2001, several MRTA members remained imprisoned in Bolivia. \r\nActivities\r\nPreviously conducted bombings, kidnappings, ambushes, and assassinations, but recent activity has fallen drastically. In December 1996, 14 MRTA members occupied the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima and held 72 hostages for more than four months. Peruvian forces stormed the residence in April 1997 rescuing all but one of the remaining hostages and killing all 14 group members, including the remaining leaders. The group has not conducted a significant terrorist operation since and appears more focused on obtaining the release of imprisoned MRTA members. \r\nStrength\r\nBelieved to be no more than 100 members, consisting largely of young fighters who lack leadership skills and experience.\r\nLocation/Area of Operation\r\nPeru with supporters throughout Latin America and Western Europe. Controls no territory.\r\nExternal Aid\r\nNone.\r\n"

        "text":"Busy Summer for Local Orchards\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 7/19/2004\r\n\r\nALDERWOOD - Though the colorful autumn days of hay rides and apple picking are a long way off, local apple orchards aren't taking any vacations.\r\nKAZ Farms, for example, continues to grow myriad produce to stock its roadside stand and the many farmers' markets they attend, according to owner Tadashi Kazuhiri.\r\n\r\nKazuhiri and his wife, Betty, have been slowly diversifying their produce lines, and keep their roadside stand open seven days a week, year-round.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we have a lot of apple production practices that need to be done, like pruning suckers (tree limbs that shoot straight up and don't produce fruit) and mowing. But we grow a lot of other things as well,\" Kazuhiri said.\r\n\r\nAmong their \"50 or so\" acres of apples, Kazuhiri said the farm also grows a four-acre field of corn timed to be ripe in October for apple season, three-fourths an acre of sweet and sour cherries, one acre of raspberries, one-half an acre of asparagus \"just harvested.\"\r\n\r\nThe Washington Road farm also grows grapes, summer squash, and three to four successive plantings of tomatoes, Kazuhiri said.\r\n\r\nKazuhiri said the farm also maintains a large long-term low-oxygen cooler that keeps apples fresh for a longer period of time.\r\n\r\n\"I've got apples for sale that still taste like they've been freshly picked,\" Kazuhiri said.\r\n\r\nIn addition to growing diverse produce, Kazuhiri said the farm is also making cider, donuts, and coring, peeling and slicing apples for baking and other uses.\r\n\r\n\"We're committed to the local market. We want local food for local people, so we definitely stay busy during the summer,\" Kazuhiri said.\r\n\r\nKazuhiri Apple's stand on Washington Road is open seven days a week, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.. In addition, KAZ Farms regularly visits the farmers markets in Sunnyside, Prosser and Kiona on Saturdays, Benton City farmers market on Sundays, Kennewick farmers market on Mondays, and the farmers market at Richland Civic Center on Tuesdays.\r\n\r\nFFE Farms on county Route 23 in Alderwood is busy during the summer maintaining its crops and building new business ventures, according to owner George Prado.\r\n\r\n\"It's really a year-round occupation. We have to set traps for insects and spray when necessary, earlier in the season. Then it's a matter of mowing and pruning, and getting ready for the harvest,\" Prado said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prado, maintaining the crop has been a bit more work than usual because of the all the rain.\r\n\r\n\"When it gets really wet in early summer it increases the activity of certain diseases in the fruit. One disease called scabs causes spots on the apples, and it comes from wet leaves on the ground. We have a fungicide we use to prevent it, and it's just a matter of being diligent and keeping things as clean as can be,\" Prado said.\r\n\r\nThere is a silver-lining to all the rain, however, as Prado said he is anticipating a \"big crop of a lot of big apples.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost as important as Prado's apple crop are his fields of asparagus.  Prado likes having the diversity, \"If you only plant one crop, you are asking for trouble.  When the apple growing season is poor, the asparagus keeps us afloat.\" \r\n\r\n\"We are busy keeping the store open and selling our summer crops. If things keep going the way they are, I'd say our future is as shiny as our apples\" Prado said with an optimistic smile.\r\n\r\nPrado said his new business ventures are also keeping him quite busy this season, with the installation of new public restrooms, a new cold storage facility, and production of hard cider and apple wine, made on site.\r\n\r\n\"We should be finishing the bottling line by the end of this month, so hard cider will be available by mid-August, if everything goes as planned,\" Prado said.\r\n\r\n\"With balloon festivals and other orchards, we know people have a lot of other options come fall. We're compelled to add new features to our business and to keep expanding what we offer,\" Prado said.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Forum\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/11/2004\r\n\r\nThis week Sen. John Kerry said that he would fight a \"more thoughtful and sensitive war on terror.\" I think it would be useful to review how we got to where we are today.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 11, 2001 Al-Quaeda terrorists tried to destroy our military headquarters, damage our economy and decapitate our government through suicide airplane attacks on the Pentagon, World Trade Center and the Capitol. They literally went for the jugular in an attempt to destroy us.\r\n\r\nPresident Bush and his administration decided to develop a long-term, broad-based response. They decided to hold responsible those who had attacked us. They started better cooperation of intelligence agencies to freeze terrorists' finances and break up their cells around the world. They have defeated two regimes that directly supported the terrorists and liberated 50 million people in the process.\r\n\r\nIraq may not have been directly involved with 9/11, but definitely had ties to terrorism, as the 9/11 Commission report verified. They harbored terrorists, paid families of suicide bombers, trained terrorists and had ties to Al-Quaeda and other terror groups. Furthermore, Saddam Hussein never proved that his WMO's were destroyed.\r\n\r\nSen. Kerry, how do we fight a \"sensitive\" war against people with whom we cannot reason?\r\n\r\nPresident Bush has responded forcefully and with vision in his primary responsibility, the defense of our nation. He has made the proper response to those who will spare nothing to kill and destroy us. He deserves our respect, support and vote.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Port Incident\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 3/5/2004\r\n\r\nThe captain of a ship involved in an accident at the Portland Port Authority pleaded innocent to criminal charges in federal court recently. The U.S. Coast Guard arrested the man last month in Portland on a criminal complaint charging him with misconduct or neglect in connection with the March 2 accident that injured several dock workers. According to the criminal complaint, the ZIM Parazuela III was maneuvering to leave port when its bow struck the lower wood dock. The impact caused several cases of apples from Washington state to fall and burst open according to investigators. The dock workers were hospitalized with mysterous burns and respiratory illnesses. \r\n\r\nAn affidavit filed by the Coast Guard Investigative Service states that the ship's engineer and second engineer told investigators that the captain failed to take action after two previous failures of the bow thruster. Prosecutors have asked to take depositions from both men, who they believe are both in Parazuela. The contracts for both men were terminated after leaving Portland, according to documents in federal court. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Magistrate Judge said she would grant the prosecution's request unless the defense objects. Taking the depositions could allow prosecutors to read the men's testimony into evidence rather than bringing them to the United States to testify in person at a trial. The accused\u0092s attorney said defense lawyers have not determined whether they will fight the deposition request. According to the affidavit, the captain told investigators that his colleagues were blaming him for the accident due to political differences. \"The two are the stinking fingers of Rojas -- he lives in mansions while the people starve!\" stated the captain, referencing the lifestyle of Parazuelan president Arturo Rojas. Possible connections between the captain and the revolutionary group, Porvenier Luminoso (Shining Future), in Parazuela are being explored.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Wash. State Migrant Council teaching people how to drive\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/7/2004\r\n\r\nNot far from where thousands of Yakima Valley residents took their driving test years ago, a new generation of drivers is getting a chance to study up before heading over to the Washington State Department of Driver Licensing office in Alderwood to try for their driver's license.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Washington State Migrant Council is offering drivers education classes at 105-D South Sixth St., on the east end of the old driver licensing department, near the Migrant Council's executive office.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to Cristina Klatovsky and Noemi Ortega with the Washington State Migrant Council, the local non-profit organization was certified to teach drivers education classes at the beginning of July and by the end of the month the first set of classes was off the ground.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question most people ask when they hear that the Migrant Council has taken on the task of offering drivers' training - is how does that fit in with what the organization is doing? Klatovsky admitted that when you first look at it there doesn't seem to be a connection.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, she explained that the Migrant Council started thinking about offering classes after a successful car seat program. She said during the car seat clinic parents bring their vehicles in to ensure that they are properly using car seats for their children. What the Migrant Council found out during the clinic is that although they were able to ensure that children were riding in cars safely, what they weren't able to do was ensure that the person driving the car had a driver's license or knew how to properly operate a vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Talking to mom and dad we kept hearing, 'We don't have a license,'\" Klatovsky said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She added that driving without a license ends up not only being a safety issue for the person behind the wheel and their passengers, but also for everyone who uses the road.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to be a problem of high priority,\" Klatovsky said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ortega noted that upon further inspection the Migrant Council discovered there was no place for bilingual or monolingual Spanish speakers to learn about drivers training. She added that the Migrant Council driving school is the first bilingual certified driving school in the state of Washington.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There is a huge need out there,\" Ortega said of bilingual drivers training.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Klatovsky said when the Migrant Council was first thinking about taking on a driving school, thoughts were of helping prepare adult drivers to pass the tests necessary to receive their license. However, when the school opened its doors staff members were surprised by the number of youths who were signing up for the class.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Klatovsky said the Migrant Council was fortunate enough to put two of its staff members, Gilbert Garza and Abdon Valdez, through training and both were certified to teach both adult and youth drivers education classes in English and Spanish.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Klatovsky said the Migrant Council driving school has been getting quite a few Granger students in its class, noting that Granger High School is no longer offering drivers education. She added that because there were so many Granger students in the first class, the Migrant Council actually had to run a van up to Granger every day to pick up the students and bring them to class.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nKlatovsky explained that even though there are quite a few youths taking advantage of the local driving school, there are also a number of adults who are turning out to gain a better understanding of the rules of the road.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are class times set up, but the schedule is very flexible and allows for one-on-one instruction. Someone who can't make it in during the regular class time or who doesn't necessarily feel comfortable in a setting like that, can come in whenever their schedule allows and go through training.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the driving class is sponsored by the Washington State Migrant Council, Klatovsky said it is open to the entire community. Klatovsky added that it is a private pay program. The cost of the class is $85 for the classroom training and $225 for the behind-the-wheel training. She noted that the driving school currently has two state certified vehicles for use in the behind-the-wheel training.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Washington State Migrant Council driving school call 1-800-478-2219 or 837-2525.\r\n\r\n"

Ki-Be was able to take advantage of that lull, and brought the score uncomfortably close to the Lady 'Hounds.\r\n\r\nLaFever said Ki-Be is a good team, adding that they are good at everything from serving to hitting.\r\n\"They really try to let you make your own mistakes,\" he said.\r\nLaFever said there were several players who did a good job for the Grandview team Tuesday night, including sophomore setter Chante Bottineau, who had 24 assists, 2 kills and 10 service points. LaFever said the two kills were a \"big deal,\" adding that Bottineau had a good night.\r\n\r\nValentina Solis was another player LaFever said played well against the Ki-Be team.\r\n\"She played really tough,\" LaFever said of Solis.\r\nSolis had 14 kills, 3 aces and 8 blocks for the night.\r\nLaFever said senior Mari Cornejo also played tough against the Lady Bears. Cornejo had 4 kills, 2 setting assists and 8 service points.\r\n\r\nDanelle Cowan also had a good night with 10 kills and 4 blocks.\r\nOn the defensive side of things, LaFever said freshman Kealey Johnston and junior Tonhya Wysong, who had 18 and 16 digs respectively, played well against the Ki-Be Bears.\r\n\r\nThe Grandview team (3-0, 4-1) will take to the court again Saturday during a tournament in Monroe. LaFever said there his team will face off against several 4A teams.\r\n"

        "text":"Guest Editorial\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/27/2004\r\n\r\nDON C. BRUNELL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Selling change is always difficult, but when it involves public schools and our kids' education, it is daunting at best. Dr. Rod Paige is President Bush's Secretary of Education and the chief architect of \"No Child Left Behind.\" Surprisingly, he is the first superintendent of schools to hold that post.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paige's father was a public school principal, his mother a public school librarian. Born in 1933 in segregated Monticello, Mississippi, Paige earned a Bachelor's degree from Jackson State University and a Master's and Doctoral degree from Indiana University. Prior to joining the Bush Cabinet, he was superintendent of schools in Houston.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Paige has a disarming style. For example, while in Seattle recently, he conducted a town hall meeting where teachers and activists confronted him over their frustrations with Washington's school reforms, the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL), and \"No Child Left Behind.\" \r\n\r\nHe listened carefully and thoughtfully responded. Most importantly, while he may have disagreed with the speaker, he respected their right to disagree.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the evening, some of his antagonists continued to disagree with him and the school reforms he supports, but he commanded the respect due to a top federal education official. Dr. Paige told the audience that tests are necessary to evaluate a student's progress. For example, without a sphygmomanometer and stethoscope, there is no way to know if a person has high blood pressure and to monitor it to ensure that treatment is working. The same goes for education-you need tools and measurements to make informed decisions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Paige also believes test scores are a measure of where students have problems, and he rejects the notion of averaging school and district test scores as an indicator of progress.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No Child Left Behind\" is not about averaging the scores of high performers and low achievers. \r\n\r\nIt is about ensuring that kids don't fall through the cracks, passed from grade to grade unable to master the skills they'll need to succeed in the real world.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, studies show that if a student cannot read proficiently after the third grade, their problems in school only compound. He encourages parents to read to their children and have their children read to them. \"No Child Left Behind\" also sets aside federal funds for tutoring students from low income and disadvantaged families.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Paige reminded his audience that President Bush has increased education funding by nearly 60 percent since the Clinton Administration left office. He also was quick to point out that funding for K-12 is the state's responsibility and the federal government supplements, not supplants, that support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFinally, Paige unabashedly supports school choice and charter schools-highly unpopular with the teachers' union. He believes all students and parents should have choices, not just the families who can afford to send their children to private schools.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being on the front line, battling for change is a tough job even with less volatile issues, but Dr. Paige has handled his job well. Americans should be grateful there are dedicated educators like Paige because their persistence will keep our country competitive and full of opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Gov. Locke, Education Secretary Rod Paige is convinced that education breaks down racial, cultural and poverty barriers. It is the great equalizer in our culture.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

The doors will open at 6:30 p.m. The question and answer session begins at 7 p.m.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Most of the farmers do not have a storm water runoff problem. But we will be taxed anyway if we do not act now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/s/ Mark D. Clemmens, Alderwood\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Local dentist honored for work with low-income children\r\nStory by: Melissa Browning\r\nDate Published to Web: 2/10/2004\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking into the under-sea themed office at Spavinaw Dental Center children are at ease as they prepare to have their teeth checked.\r\n\r\nImmediately put at ease with the peaceful surroundings, it's the wall of pictures of smiling children that catch the eye of visitors. The wall displays patients who are cavity free. Every one of the pictures is of kids, who have learned good dental health from their friendly dentist, Dr. Gregory Norell, who at 6'5\" has been described as a \"gentle giant\" who uses humor and charisma to charm his young patients.\r\n\r\nNorell, the owner of the clinic, focuses on children's dental health, which is why he is being honored in Washington D.C. later this month.\r\n\r\nNorell, 38, will receive the 2004 Plate of Bounty Award at the National Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Conference in Washington D.C. The award will be presented to Norell at the Mexican Embassy.\r\n\r\n\"The Plate of Bounty award is given each year to the persons in the United States who have made outstanding contributions to their communities and specifically to the Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program,\" said Manda Lopez, executive director of the National Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Association.\r\n\r\nSince 2001, Norell has been working closely with the Washington State Migrant Council and EPIC (Enterprise for Progress in the Community) Head Start, providing dental check-ups, fluoride and sealants at the Head Start centers from Yakima to Pasco and many communities in the Columbia Basin. Most of the children he serves at the centers are low-income or disabled.\r\n\r\n\"I love going out to the day cares and the Migrant Council centers,\" he said. \"People are less pretensive.\"\r\nNorell said the idea to visit the different Head Start sites came after speaking to Barb Williams, Washington State Migrant Council health coordinator.\r\n\r\n\"She wanted something simple, other than having the kids come to the office, which isn't very effective,\" said Norell.\r\nHe was nominated for the Plate of Bounty award by Williams and Jennifer Weiss Standley, health and nutrition program manager for EPIC.\r\n\r\nNorell, who mostly treats children, estimates that about 90 percent of his patients are low-income children and their families.\r\nHe said he saw a high need for dental care for children in the Lower Valley and especially those who are from low-income families.\r\n\"It makes me feel like I'm filling a role,\" said Norell. \"I'm proud to accept this on the behalf of my office.\"\r\n\r\nA native of Oklahoma, Norell graduated from Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma with a degree in biology in 1987. He worked for a biotechnology company, in a laboratory and in the sales field for several years before he was encouraged by friends to pursue a degree in dentistry. He attended the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry, which he graduated from in 1997, the same year he opened a practice in Grandview.\r\n\r\n\"In 2002 Greg realized there was a need in the Lower Alderwood Valley to provide dental services to low income and migrant families in Alderwood and surrounding areas,\" said Clydine Norell, wife of Dr. Norell, in a biography she wrote on her husband.\r\n\r\nNorell helped develop the SmileSavers program, which is run by the Washington State Dental Foundation in Pasco, before opening his office in Alderwood.\r\nHe is also the owner of Eastway Dental.\r\n\r\n"

It is being sponsored by the Tri-Cities Visitor and Convention Bureau, Desert Lorax and the Tri-Cities Ultimate Frisbee Club.\r\nCompetition will take place between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 30, and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 31. Generally, four games take place simultaneously. The final championship tournament will be staged Sunday afternoon.\r\nFor extra flavor, competing teams will don Halloween costumes in keeping with the theme, \"Hanford Howl.\"\r\nThe two-day tournament will involve teams from across the Pacific Northwest. At least 300 people are expected to compete.\r\n\"Events such as these are not only fun, they benefit the community since proceeds from this tournament are donated to charity,\" said Kris Watkins, president of the Tri-Cities Visitor and Convention Bureau.\r\nSally McFarlane, the tournament's publicity coordinator, is encouraging the public to attend, at no charge, and learn more about the sport of Ultimate Frisbee.\r\n\"It's a fast paced team sport that combines the elements of soccer, football and basketball. Players try to pass the Frisbee down the field into an end zone to score goals,\" said McFarlane.\r\n\"Generally, there are seven players on each coed team, four men and three women,\" she continued. \"A very unique aspect of the Ultimate Frisbee sport is the fact that the game is played without referees or officials. It requires the players to call their own fouls and relies on what is called the 'spirit of the game,\" a concept that promotes competitive play but not at the expense of sportsmanship.\"\r\n\u00a0"

(AP)  Two teenage boys were arrested on charges of criminal trespass after a video allegedly showing the duo breaking into a deserted missile silo outside of Alderwood, Washington was posted online at MySpace.com, a social networking site. Alderwood police said a tip led them to watch the video, which provided clues for identifying location and the teens who were arrested Tuesday. In the clip, two boys each are seen climbing into the site, said Alderwood Police Lt. Jose Hernandez. The silo used to house missile protection for the Groves Weapons Annex south of town, but was abandoned and decommissioned in the early 1990's according to Hernandez. The teens claimed to be investigating suspicious activity at the missile site, where they insisted people are still working.\r\n\r\nHernandez said police officers in Alderwood are beginning to surf the MySpace site for signs that local teenagers may be involved in criminal activity such as drug or alcohol use, sexual assault or vandalism.\r\n\r\n\"The two are being charged with criminal trespass and criminal mischief, both Class A misdemeanors, and bond was set at $500 each.... The FBI is involved in the case and federal charges are pending.\" added Hernandez.\r\n"

        "text":"Alderwood Planning Commission OK's annexation\r\nStory by: Mel Sacher\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/9/2004\r\n\r\nA 3.24-acre parcel of land located near the corner of North 16th Street and Sheller Road has been recommended for annexation into the city limits of Alderwood. The annexation request was reviewed Wednesday night by the Alderwood Planning Commission.\r\n\r\nProperty owners Rene and Paula Lemos filed the petition that would annex their property into the city limits. They requested that the land be zoned as R-3, high density residential.\r\n\r\nDeveloper John Probst, who has been involved in annexing more than 400 acres of land into the Alderwood city limits, spoke on behalf of the Lemos family. He is currently working with the Diocese of Yakima Housing Services on the feasibility of developing a multi-family housing project, similar to the one in Mabton, in Alderwood.\r\n\r\nAlderwood city attorney Bruce Rinz said the city also has a notice of intent to annex from the property owners to the east of the Lemos property, which is owned by the Burns family. Probst is also working with the Burns'.\r\n\r\nThe Lemos annexation was first scheduled for public hearing on Aug. 18, but was postponed due to lack of planning commission quorum on three occasions.\r\n\r\nProbst said that canvassing the maps of Alderwood there is very little R-3 zoned property in the city that is not developed.\r\n\r\nHe said the Catholic diocese is looking to build a 51-unit townhouse development, but the agency is still in the early planning stages to see if the property would be viable. The housing in the development would be consistent with an R-2 zoning, said Probst. Initial plans are to build about 9 units per acre over the Lemos and Burns property. He added that the plans call for green space, three playground areas and a small play field. A community building would also be in the plans.\r\n\r\n\"We don't like ultra-high density,\" said Probst.\r\n\r\nMulti-family townhouses are a conditional use in an R-2 zone. The reason the R-3 zoning was requested, said Probst, is because the diocese would also like to build a 2,000 square foot office building with six offices and a library on the property. He said the diocese would like to unite their services in the Lower Valley under one roof.\r\n\r\nProbst said he is currently working with the Alderwood Valley Irrigation District, which is putting together a cost estimate to pipe the canal on the Lemos' 16th Avenue frontage.\r\n\r\n\"Right now it's all conceptual,\" said Rinz.\r\n\r\nTraffic was a concern voiced by residents and echoed by Planning Commissioner Brent Cleghorn. With two new schools slated to be built just off Washout Road, the possibility of a bottleneck at the four-way intersection of North 16th Street, North Avenue, Washout and Sheller roads was a concern to neighbors and Cleghorn.\r\n\r\n\"When the school is constructed, as things stand now, it would not be within the city limits,\" said Rinz.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Alderwood County is studying how wide Washout Road should be, said Rinz, who added that most likely the road will be widened to three lanes.\r\n\r\nThe planning commissioners questioned as to if there is a possibility of putting a stop light where the four-way stop signs are currently located.\r\n\r\nRinz said most of the time, because of the costs, stop lights are not installed until there is a need. When a need is evident then grant funding is sought, he explained.\r\n\r\nRinz cited the recent study of Midvale and Alexander roads, when it was determined that there wasn't enough traffic to warrant a stop light. He said that experts said it would most likely be another 20 years before there is enough traffic to warrant a stop light at that intersection.\r\n\r\n\"There has to be a lot of traffic for a stop light to be put in,\" Rinz said.\r\n\r\nCleghorn wondered if it wouldn't be better to wait for the new schools to be established before the annexation decision is made.\r\n\r\nNeighborhood resident Stan Bos, whose home looks onto the Lemos property, said there are currently a lot of low income apartments in his neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"Currently, we are surrounded by a lot of high density residential,\" said Bos.\r\n\r\nIn the 27 years he has lived in his neighborhood he has seen a change in traffic patterns, he added. Now, 16th Street is a major thoroughfare.\r\n\r\n\"As I see it now I feel this is a plan that needs some work and I don't support it,\" Bos added.\r\n\r\nNorth Avenue resident Ron Hochhalter said, \"I have no objection to your plan, but I think we have enough of this housing on this side of town. We don't need more of this low income housing on the north side of town.\"\r\n\r\nCleghorn said he felt uncomfortable making a decision on the annexation Wednesday night with so many questions unanswered.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Probst said, his time to apply for funding is running to an end. His grant deadline is Sept. 29.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty or sixty days ago I could have said I will get you that information, but time has been ate up,\" said Probst, adding that the issue was originally set for public hearing earlier this summer.\r\n\r\n\"I have problems with this,\" said Cleghorn. \"I feel my back's against the wall. It bothers me to push it through.\r\n\r\n\"I'm concerned with the development of the schools. I have concerns with the amount of low income housing in the city. Although, your's would be the nicest here in the city,\" Cleghorn told Probst.\r\n\r\nAt the request of Planning Commissioner Barry Weaver the vote was split into two separate issues. The first issue was whether the property should be annexed into the city and the second issue was to decide if it should be zoned R-2.\r\n\r\nBoth votes by the seven-person commission were affirmative. Commissioners Cleghorn and Ken Bierlink were the only two to oppose annexing the property into the city limits, and Commissioners Cleghorn, Bierlink and Rolando Alvarez were in the minority in opposing the rezone of the property to R-2.\r\n\r\nThe official recommendations of the Planning Commission will be forwarded to the Alderwood City Council for final adoption.\r\n"

        "text":"Mabton grid team tethers Billy Goats\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 10/18/2004\r\n\r\nPATEROS - The Pateros Billy Goats were undefeated in Central Washington 'B' League play heading into last Friday's football game against visiting Mabton. They no longer are.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mabton bullied the Billy Goats enroute to scoring a 35-17 conference victory.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was big,\" said Mabton Coach D.J. Search. \"We out-physicaled them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The coaches and kids did a good of watching film last week. We were all confident we were going to be more physical than them,\" Search said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Search credits his offensive and defensive lines for taking control of the game. \"Both lines played outstanding,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defensively, Mabton limited Pateros to just 86 rushing yards. The Billy Goats did gain about 150 yards through the air, although the Pateros QB, Zahn, was picked once. The interception was claimed by Mabton free safety Ryan Harris.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Search explained that Pateros employed a spread offense against his club, often times using pro sets in the backfield.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We just played assignment defense against them,\" he said. \"We stayed in our 5-3 defense, except on 3rd and long plays when we jumped into something else.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were very physical against them,\" Search added. \"Our whole defense did their job. They came to play. Tackling was very good.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offensively, the Vikings' line was just as physical, which resulted in some large holes being opened for Mabton's running backs. The Vikes' leading ground gainers were Pablo Sanchez, Alex Zavala and Ray Elizondo. Sanchez tallied 108 yards on the ground on 13 carries. Zavala scooted for 93 yards on 10 totes, and Elizondo ran the ball 11 times for 61 yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mabton QB Ryan Harris didn't have to air it out much Friday night. He only attempted nine passes, completing three of them for 80 yards. Zavala had two of the receptions, accouting for 72 of the 80 passing yards.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Vikes opened a 14-0 lead on Pateros with two first quarter scores. Sanchez had the first TD, that coming on a 61-yard breakaway run. Harris had a 2-yard dive for the second touchdown.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pateros countered with a 39-yard TD pass late in the opening quarter to cut Mabton's lead to 14-6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Vikes responded in the second quarter, though, punching in two more touchdowns to build their lead to 28-6. Jovanni Ochoa, on his only carry of the game because Sanchez's helmet was broken, scored the first of the two TD's on a 3-yard plunge. The other touchdown came on Sanchez's second score of the night, a 9-yard scamper.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pateros closed the gap to 28-10 just before the half on a 28-yard field goal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mabton added an insurance score in the third quarter when Zavala broke loose and raced 16 yards for a TD. Marco Zepeda followed up the touchdown with his fifth consecutive successful PAT kick of the night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Billy Goats got a second TD pass from Zahn in the final quarter to account for the final 35-17 score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Last Friday's win improved Mabton's South Central 'B' League record to 4-2, 5-2 overall. The Vikings are scheduled to play a non-league game at Highland (3-4) this coming Friday.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pateros slipped to 4-1 in conference play with the loss, and the Billy Goats still have to play league leading Waterville (5-0)."

Growers, however, bristled at that accusation. \"E. Coli can occur in unpasturized apple juice, but we were giving out clean fresh apples. With all the recent beef problems in Alderwood, I think an investigation into uncooked meats at the festival may be in order,\" stated George Prado, owner of the local FFE farms. \"I strongly agree with Mr. Prado,\" added \"Kaz\" Kazuhiri, owner of KAZ farms.  \"Where's the beef?  Let's get the Laboratory out here!\"\r\n\r\nBoynton Laboratories, Alderwood's world renouned research institute specializing in bovine illness, declined to become involved with the investigation, stating their interest areas focused on diseases of live bovines and not inadequate cooking procedures.\r\n"

        "text":"Sulfur Mustard FactSheet\r\n\r\nWhat sulfur mustard is\r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard is a type of chemical warfare agent. These kinds of agents are called vesicants or blistering agents, because they cause blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard is also known as \u0093mustard gas or mustard agent,\u0094 or by the military designations H, HD, and HT. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard sometimes smells like garlic, onions, or mustard and sometimes has no odor. It can be a vapor (the gaseous form of a liquid), an oily-textured liquid, or a solid. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard can be clear to yellow or brown when it is in liquid or solid form. \r\n\r\nWhere sulfur mustard is found and how it is used\r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard is not found naturally in the environment. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard was introduced in World War I as a chemical warfare agent. Until recently, it was available for use in the treatment of a skin condition called psoriasis. Currently, it has no medical use. \r\n\r\nHow people can be exposed to sulfur mustard\r\n\u0095\tIf sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind. \r\n\u0095\tIf sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin. \r\n\u0095\tPeople can be exposed by coming in contact with liquid sulfur mustard. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard can last from 1 to 2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect (that is, it can build up in the body). \r\n\r\nHow sulfur mustard works\r\n\u0095\tAdverse health effects caused by sulfur mustard depend on the amount people are exposed to, the route of exposure, and the length of time that people are exposed. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory (breathing) tract. \r\n\u0095\tIt damages DNA, a vital component of cells in the body. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas. \r\n\r\nImmediate signs and symptoms of sulfur mustard exposure\r\n\u0095\tExposure to sulfur mustard is usually not fatal. When sulfur mustard was used during World War I, it killed fewer than 5% of the people who were exposed and got medical care. \r\n\u0095\tPeople may not know right away that they have been exposed, because sulfur mustard often has no smell or has a smell that might not cause alarm. \r\n\u0095\tTypically, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. Depending on the severity of the exposure, symptoms may not occur for 2 to 24 hours. Some people are more sensitive to sulfur mustard than are other people, and may have symptoms sooner. \r\n\u0095\tSulfur mustard can have the following effects on specific parts of the body: \r\no\tSkin: redness and itching of the skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure and change eventually to yellow blistering of the skin. \r\no\tEyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur within 3 to12 hours of a mild to moderate exposure. A severe exposure may cause symptoms within 1 to 2 hours and may include the symptoms of a mild or moderate exposure plus light sensitivity, severe pain, or blindness (lasting up to 10 days). \r\no\tRespiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough within 12 to 24 hours of a mild exposure and within 2 to 4 hours of a severe exposure. \r\no\tDigestive tract: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting. \r\n\u0095\tShowing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sulfur mustard. \r\n\r\nWhat the long-term health effects may be\r\n\u0095\tExposure to sulfur mustard liquid is more likely to produce second- and third- degree burns and later scarring than is exposure to sulfur mustard vapor. Extensive skin burning can be fatal. \r\n\u0095\tExtensive breathing in of the vapors can cause chronic respiratory disease, repeated respiratory infections, or death. \r\n\u0095\tExtensive eye exposure can cause permanent blindness. \r\n\u0095\tExposure to sulfur mustard may increase a person\u0092s risk for lung and respiratory cancer. \r\n\r\nHow people can protect themselves and what they should do if they are exposed to sulfur mustard\r\n\u0095\tBecause no antidote exists for sulfur mustard exposure, the best thing to do is avoid it. Immediately leave the area where the sulfur mustard was released. Try to find higher ground, because sulfur mustard is heavier than air and will settle in low-lying areas. \r\n\u0095\tIf avoiding sulfur mustard exposure is not possible, rapidly remove the sulfur mustard from the body. Getting the sulfur mustard off as soon as possible after exposure is the only effective way to prevent or decrease tissue damage to the body. \r\n\u0095\tQuickly remove any clothing that has liquid sulfur mustard on it. If possible, seal the clothing in a plastic bag, and then seal that bag inside a second plastic bag. \r\n\u0095\tImmediately wash any exposed part of the body (eyes, skin, etc.) thoroughly with plain, clean water. Eyes need to be flushed with water for 5 to 10 minutes. Do NOT cover eyes with bandages, but do protect them with dark glasses or goggles. \r\n\u0095\tIf someone has ingested sulfur mustard, do NOT induce vomiting. Give the person milk to drink. \r\n\u0095\tSeek medical attention right away. Dial 911 and explain what has happened. \r\n\r\nHow sulfur mustard exposure is treated\r\nThe most important factor is removing sulfur mustard from the body. Exposure to sulfur mustard is treated by giving the victim supportive medical care to minimize the effects of the exposure. Though no antidote exists for sulfur mustard, exposure is usually not fatal.\r\n\r\nWhere people can get more information about sulfur mustard\r\n\r\nFor more information about sulfur mustard, people can contact the following:\r\n\u0095\tRegional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 \r\n\u0095\tCenters for Disease Control and Prevention \r\no\tPublic Response Hotline (CDC) \r\n?\t800-CDC-INFO \r\n?\t888-232-6348 (TTY) \r\no\tE-mail inquiries: cdcinfo@cdc.gov \r\n\r\nThis fact sheet is based on CDC\u0092s best current information. It may be updated as new information becomes available.\r\n"

Cowan didn't play at the jamboree.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We were a little different team,\" LaFever said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He added that overall his dteam did very well against the Bulldogs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We played some very good volleyball, until we fell apart,\" LaFever said of the two matches.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to LaFever, his team fell apart about halfway through the match-up with Selah. The Lady 'Hounds managed to win the first game of the afternoon against the Lady Vikings, 25-11, but never found their rhythm after that, falling to the Selah team by scores of 25-21, 25-11 and 25-15.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Selah was able to take us out of our game and we didn't make good adjustments,\" LaFever said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He added that the Lady Vikings were able to do a couple of things that took his team out of its offense.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We got a little frustrated and played poorly,\" LaFever said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overall, LaFever said he was happy with the girls' performance during the first four or five games of the afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We're starting to get there, we're showing an increasing amount of promise,\" LaFever said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LaFever noted that both Tonhya Wysong and Cowan played well Saturday. Wysong had 46 digs for the afternoon, while Cowan had 32 kills, 27 digs and 9 blocks. Also helping the Grandview team were Angie Cabrera with 6 kills and 29 digs, Kealey Johnston with 8 kills and 35 digs, Valentina Solis with 18 kills, 6 blocks and 8 aces, Mari Cornejo with 8 kills and 7 blocks, and Chante Bottineau, who had 68 assists.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lady 'Hounds (2-0, 3-1) will play again Tuesday night at Ki-Be.\r\n\r\n"

        "text":"Escherichia coli FactSheet\r\n\r\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 is an emerging cause of foodborne illness. An estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths occur in the United States each year. Infection often leads to bloody diarrhea, and occasionally to kidney failure. Most illness has been associated with eating undercooked, contaminated ground beef. Person-to-person contact in families and child care centers is also an important mode of transmission. Infection can also occur after drinking raw milk and after swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. \r\n\r\nConsumers can prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection by thoroughly cooking ground beef, avoiding unpasteurized milk, and washing hands carefully.\r\nBecause the organism lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, preventive measures on cattle farms and during meat processing are beinginvestigated. \r\n________________________________________\r\nWhat is Escherichia coli O157:H7?\r\n\r\nE. coli O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although most strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals, this strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. \r\n\r\nE. coli O157:H7 was first recognized as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea; the outbreak was traced to contaminated hamburgers. Since then, most infections have come from eating undercooked ground beef. \r\n\r\nThe combination of letters and numbers in the name of the bacterium refers to the specific markers found on its surface and distinguishes it from other types of E. coli. \r\nBack to Top \r\nHow is E. coli O157:H7 spread?\r\n\r\nThe organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle. Meat can become contaminated during slaughter, and organisms can be thoroughly mixed into beef when it is ground. Bacteria present on the cow's udders or on equipment may get into raw milk. \r\n\r\nEating meat, especially ground beef, that has not been cooked sufficiently to kill E. coli O157:H7 can cause infection. Contaminated meat looks and smells normal. Although the number of organisms required to cause disease is not known, it is suspected to be very small. \r\n\r\nAmong other known sources of infection are consumption of sprouts, lettuce, salami, unpasteurized milk and juice, and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. \r\nBacteria in diarrheal stools of infected persons can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or handwashing habits are inadequate.\r\nThis is particularly likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of becoming infected. \r\n\r\nYoung children typically shed the organism in their feces for a week or two after their illness resolves. Older children rarely carry the organism without symptoms. \r\nBack to Top \r\nWhat illness does E. coli O157:H7 cause?\r\n\r\nE. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps; sometimes the infection causes nonbloody diarrhea or no symptoms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days. \r\n\r\nIn some persons, particularly children under 5 years of age and the elderly, the infection can also cause a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. About 2%-7% of infections lead to this complication. In the United States, hemolytic uremic syndrome is the principal cause of acute kidney failure in children, and most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome are caused by E. coli O157:H7. \r\nBack to Top \r\nHow is E. coli O157:H7 infection diagnosed?\r\n\r\nInfection with E. coli O157:H7 is diagnosed by detecting the bacterium in the stool. Most laboratories that culture stool do not test for E. coli O157:H7, so it is important to request that the stool specimen be tested on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar for this organism. All persons who suddenly have diarrhea with blood should get their stool tested for E. coli O157:H7. \r\nBack to Top \r\nHow is the illness treated?\r\n\r\nMost persons recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 5-10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and it is thought that treatment with some antibiotics may precipitate kidney complications. Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide (Imodium), should also be avoided. \r\n\r\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an intensive care unit. Blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive care, the death rate for hemolytic uremic syndrome is 3%-5%. \r\nBack to Top \r\nWhat are the long-term consequences of infection?\r\n\r\nPersons who only have diarrhea usually recover completely. \r\n\r\nAbout one-third of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, and the effects of having part of their bowel removed. \r\nBack to Top \r\nWhat can be done to prevent the infection?\r\n\r\nE. coli O157:H7 will continue to be an important public health concern as long as it contaminates meat. Preventive measures may reduce the number of cattle that carry it and the contamination of meat during slaughter and grinding. Research into such prevention measures is just beginning. \r\nBack to Top \r\nWhat can you do to prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection?\r\n\r\nCook all ground beef and hamburger thoroughly. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria are killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure thorough cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least 160\u00ba F. Persons who cook ground beef without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not eating ground beef patties that are still pink in the middle.\r\nIf you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate, too.\r\nAvoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that require further cooking.\r\nDrink only pasteurized milk, juice, or cider. Commercial juice with an extended shelf-life that is sold at room temperature (e.g. juice in cardboard boxes, vacuum sealed juice in glass containers) has been pasteurized, although this is generally not indicated on the label. Juice concentrates are also heated sufficiently to kill pathogens. \r\nWash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially those that will not be cooked. Children under 5 years of age, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts until their safety can be assured. Methods to decontaminate alfalfa seeds and sprouts are being investigated. \r\n\r\nDrink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or other effective disinfectants.\r\nAvoid swallowing lake or pool water while swimming. See more information about this.\r\nMake sure that persons with diarrhea, especially children, wash their hands carefully with soap after bowel movements to reduce the risk of spreading infection, and that persons wash hands after changing soiled diapers. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in public pools or lakes, sharing baths with others, and preparing food for others. \r\n\r\nFor more information about reducing your risk of foodborne illness, visit the US Department of Agriculture\u0092s Food Safety and Inspection Service website at:   http://www.fsis.usda.gov or the Partnership for Food Safety Education at: For more advice on cooking ground beef, visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture web site at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OA/topics/gb.htm\r\n \r\n"

Box\u00a0 149, Alderwood, WA 98944.\r\nRoses are red, violets are blue, the sky is grey, dark and we can\u0092t believe it\u0092s true. Everyone is grieving we miss you so much, Dad, we wish you could tell us what to do. We need your advice and guidance. You were taken away too soon. So many emotions are running through all bottled up inside. We need you and know we didn\u0092t say it enough, but we love you. We wish this was just a bad dream and you would come and comfort us soon, but this nightmare is reality even though we don\u0092t want to believe it's true. So if you\u0092re looking down touch our shoulders, tell us you\u0092re OK. We miss you so much Dad. God be with us and you. What should we do? We feel like we let you down. Put your arms around us and tell us it isn\u0092t true. We feel your presence and know you\u0092re here. Tell God we still love Him even though he took you. We miss you so much Dad, we\u0092ll always love you.\u00a0 David and CJ\r\n\u00a0\r\nROBERTA F. WARREN\r\nRoberta F.

        "text":"Alderwood School Board approves $50.1 million budget\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/27/2004\r\n\r\nThursday evening, the Alderwood School Board unanimously approved a $50.1 million budget for the 2004-05 school year. The newly approved budget is an increase over the $45.6 million budget school board members approved last year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although budget expenditures are greater this year, so is the amount of revenue the district is expecting to bring in during the 2004-05 school year. According to the new budget the district is expecting $51.9 million in revenue for the year, up from $47.9 million last year. \r\n\r\nDave Plesha, executive director of business for the Alderwood School District, explained that one of the reasons for that increase is a $2.5 million grant for which the district applied. He noted that the grant would make the Alderwood Secondary Education of Migrant Youth (SEMY) location the keeper of the national database for migrant students. Plesha explained that even if the district ends up not receiving the grant it is something that had to budgeted for, just in case the district is selected.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also increased this year is the number of students expected to walk through the doors of the schools that make up the Alderwood School District.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This year's enrollment is expected to increase by approximately 48 students. This year the district is expecting to have 5,442 students enrolled in Alderwood schools, which is up from the 5,394 that attended classes last year. Plesha also pointed out there are 34 students expected to take advantage of the Running Start program, which allows students to attend classes at Yakima Valley Community College while still being a student at Alderwood High School.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often times when there is an increase in the number of students, there is also an increase in the number of teachers and other school staff members, and this year is no different. The Alderwood School District plans to employ 364 certified staff members and 230 classified staff members. This is an increase of seven certified staff members over last year, and an increase of 10 classified staff members.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nPlesha noted that this year's budget reflects only a few small raises for district staff members holding certain positions. He explained that the state allowed for a 1 percent pay rate increase for classified staff members. Plesha also pointed out that teachers will be receiving anywhere from no raise to a 7 percent raise this year depending on how many years they have been teaching and whether or not they earned any college credits over the past year. Plesha noted that the state also granted no raise for administrators this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to the capital projects fund, Plesha explained that the entire amount of the bond issue recently passed by voters is included in the $11.4 million budget. Plesha said this year money from the capital projects fund will help get the new middle school project started. The new school is expected to be constructed on land located along Washout Road. Plesha said although the entire amount to the bond is in the budget, he is only expecting to spend about $3 million this year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The transportation vehicle fund is also seeing an increase in funding this year. According to the budget, the fund totals $784,600, compared to $767,000 last year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This year the debt service fund shows a slight increase over last year. This year total expenditures are budgeted at $1.8 million compared to $1.31 million last year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dollar amounts in the Associated Student Body Fund only shifted by roughly $7,000. This year the budget is set at $517,801, which is a little more than the $510,710 budgeted last year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

        "text":"REC to hold festive sunset meeting for 10 years of service\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/29/2004\r\n\r\nWith little more than three months left of existence, the Lower Alderwood Valley Rural Enterprise Community (REC) is planning on going out in style.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tuesday night, members of the REC board met to hear reports about how some of the funds they recently distributed are being spent, and how they are going to commemorate the organization's 10 years of work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDec. 31, the local REC, like all rural enterprise communities across the country, will dissolve after having spent 10 years distributing grant funds for different projects that helped benefit the local community.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joan Souders, REC board chair, said after the group's last meeting she was approached by Alderwood Community Hospital officials wanting to host a sunset meeting for the board. Souders reported that the hospital said it would host the event, and include cookies, coffee and juice.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sunset meeting will serve as a farewell to REC and to recognize all of the people who have helped the board over the past decade. Souders said she is expecting about 50 people to attend the meeting, which will take place Nov. 16.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nSouders then asked board members if they would be willing to head out into the communities of the Lower Valley to photograph some of the projects REC has been a part of. She said the pictures will then be included in a PowerPoint presentation to be made during the sunset meeting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few of the projects that will be discussed during the sunset meeting include several that were discussed Tuesday night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sandra Linde with Alderwood Community Hospital talked about how the $5,000 that was recently granted to her project is already being utilized. Linde said orders have been made for hands-on medical models, including skeletons for Alderwood High School, Alderwood Christian High School, Grandview High School, Grandview Middle School and Harrison Middle School.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linde said things are also coming together for the certified nursing training that is being made possible thanks to REC funds. She said the curriculum has been reviewed and a teacher has been found.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"So we're just moving ahead,\" Linde said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Linde also reported on how some of the initial funds granted to the hospital from REC have been put to use. She said because of the funds the hospital was able to host an education day for seniors interested in doing their senior project on a job in the medical field. She said after the one-day seminar, 22 students were selected to take part in the hospital's senior project program. The students will be matched with a mentor and will have opportunities to volunteer their time at the hospital for the rest of their senior year. Linde explained that Alderwood seniors are required to spend 15 hours volunteering. She said at the hospital half of those hours will be spent volunteering in a specific area of the hospital that a student is interested in, while the other half will be spent volunteering at different hospital events, like the recent Women's Health Night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This would never have happened if it hadn't been for you,\" Linde told the board.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chris Gonzalez with Horizon of Alderwood Inc. said the funds received by the local organization are being used to offer more computer classes to people who need them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He explained that the funds are being used to offer basic computer classes, as well as more advanced classes that teach people how to use different programs like Excel and PowerPoint.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gonzalez said the more advanced classes not only help local business owners learn how to use the computer to better the way they do business, they also help make people more employable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAccording to Gonzalez, since having received initial funding from REC, Horizon had served 75 students in its computer classes, 35 students through its Spanish as a Second Language computer program, and has given 55 students working on their GED access to computers. In total, 295 people have had access to Horizon's technology center.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cristina Klatovsky with the Washington Migrant Council talked to the board about how the Alderwood Community Center has been able to utilize the additional funding it recently received.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She said so far $3,200 of the $5,000 it received has been spent on a variety of new catering equipment for the facility. She said the center has already been able to cater several events thanks to the new equipment, noting it helps give the center a more professional look when it is being used for meetings.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now we look more professional, and we need to look professional,\" Klatovsky said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The REC board also took a look at their finances. According to the fiscal report, the board has obligated the remainder of its funds with $3,717 left to cover closing costs for the organization.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"

Murray have different ideas about how the nation should be run.\r\n\r\nHe said that looking at Sen. Murray's voting record there is a history of voting for higher taxes. He added that she has voted 282 times to raise taxes. Nethercutt added that he has consistently supported lowering taxes.\r\n\r\n\"That's the right thing to do,\" he said.\r\n\"She thinks government creates a strong economy. I believe small business builds a strong economy,\" Nethercutt told his Lower Valley supporters.\r\nHe added that Murray's voting record taxes people at all walks of life.\r\n\r\n\"She didn't want to give parents a child tax credit,\" said Nethercutt.\r\n\r\nHe added that she wanted first-time taxpayers to pay more, and was also in favor of hirer business taxes, and an increase in taxes for retired people and senior citizens drawing social security.\r\n\"I believe we should have permanent tax relief,\" said Nethercutt.\r\n\r\nHe said next year because of Murray's voting the average family of four earning $40,000 should expect to pay an increase of $940 in taxes. He added that the relief giving tax credit to married couples, which Sen. Murray doesn't support, is set to expire, which means that non-married couples living together will pay less in taxes than married couples.\r\n\r\n\"These are bad judgments by Patty Murray,\" Nethercutt said.\r\nOn the issue of homeland security, Nethercutt said that Sen. Murray believes that the United States is the first line of defense.\r\n\r\n\"I know that the last line of defense is our homeland,\" he said, adding that he feels it is important to fight terrorism where it's at.\r\nHe added that the senator has repeatedly voted to weaken the country's military, first by promising 12 years ago to cut $100 billion out of the defense budget.\r\n\"'She also voted to cut $6 billion out of the intelligence budget just before Sept. 11,\" said Nethercutt.\r\n\r\nNethercutt, who flew to Washington D.C. this past Monday to vote 'yes' on torte reform, only to fly back to the state Tuesday for the primary election, said that his opponent won't vote for torte reform, essentially choosing trial lawyers over patients.\r\n\r\n\"She won't vote for any medical liability referendum,\" said Nethercutt.\r\nNethercutt said he is willing to put his voting record up against Murray's anytime and that he has invited the Senator to debate in every county in Washington state.\r\n\"The best way to see what people believe is through a debate,\" said Nethercutt. \"She won't debate.\"\r\n"

When the Alderwood library becomes a part of the regional system, it will be governed by the regional board.\r\n\r\nNext week, the local library board will meet to begin the transition of the local leadership to the regional system, said John Saras.\r\n\"The local library board will meet Tuesday, March 23, to make a decision about what will become of that board,\" said Saras.\r\n\"I expect a new Friends of the Library group will be formed at a later date,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe group that worked on the Alderwood library annexation has already expressed an interest in helping with the transition, said Pat Kezele, who was the ballot chairman.\r\n\"We are looking forward to forming a 'Friends' group as a local advisory body to the regional system,\" Kezele said.\r\n\r\nAlderwood Interim City Manager Mike Rinz said the city had budgeted $65,000 for the local library this year, but with the passage of the annexation, the regional library system will be helping to maintain the library through this year.\r\n\"We expect to begin the transition talks with the regional system soon,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWeyhe said she expects surveys will be distributed to the library patrons at a later date to determine what future services patrons would like to see at the library.\r\n\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Curriculum developed detailing how Americans were forced from their homes and locked away in concentration camps\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/16/2004\r\n\r\nWhen Kara Kondo was a young girl she was taken from her home, forced to give up nearly all of her possessions and was escorted to a train by armed soldiers for a long trek to a concentration camp she would call home.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kondo was not a criminal. She had done nothing wrong. The only crime she committed was living on the west coast of the United States during World War II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhen the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, the world changed for Kondo and others like her. People who had moved from Japan to the United States decades earlier were suddenly being accused of spying for their home country.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You're a traitor, more like a spy. Why, because you're Caucasian or African American or Asian or European or Middle Eastern. There have been allegations against 'your people,' not Americans, but the people [who] share your skin color, of spying. You might not have known, but it's safer to put all of 'you' away, just in case, since color and ancestry, not personality, determines whether you are trustworthy or not.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This is basically what President Roosevelt said to all people with at least 1/16 Japanese blood living in California, western Oregon, western Washington and southern Arizona, citizen or not, in February of 1942 in Executive Order 9066,\" writes Elizabeth Church, a student in Irene Wells's class at Discovery Lab School in Yakima.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe students in Wells's class spent an entire school year researching the experiences of Japanese Americans during the United States' involvement in World War II. The middle school students interviewed Japanese Americans who lived in the Yakima Valley during that point in history, read books about relocation centers and visited museums to learn about the experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kondo, one of the women interviewed by the students for the project, said during the taped interview that she remembers calling the relocation centers, concentration camps.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Relocation center is a nice term for concentration camps,\" Kondo said in the tape.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kondo, who was born in the Yakima Valley and grew up in Wapato, told the students that her father came to the United States from Japan in 1905, with her mother following in 1912. She said her mother grew up in a privileged family in Kobe, Japan, leaving it all to live with her husband in the brush land of eastern Washington.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can't imagine what it was like in 1912,\" Kondo said. She explained to Wells's class that it was all sagebrush, with dirt roads meant for horse and buggy traffic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nKondo added that making the adjustment was difficult for her mother, who couldn't speak English.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not sure how she got through it,\" Kondo said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, her mother wasn't the only Japanese immigrant working to adjust to life in the Yakima Valley. Kondo explained during the interview that in the 1920s the Valley became a popular area for Japanese immigrants to settle. She noted that once the Japanese began to arrive in the Valley, they started to isolate themselves. She said the Japanese immigrants couldn't speak English, ate different foods and had their own traditions. She told the students that isolation meant they could speak to each other in their own language and eat familiar foods, making it feel more like home.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was a small community within a larger community,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kondo told the students that the Japanese community in the Yakima Valley had their own clubs and churches. She said the Japanese Methodist Church was established in the early 1920s and the Japanese Buddhist Church was established in the early 1930s in Wapato.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the reasons Japanese immigrants settled in the Yakima Valley, Kondo said in the tape, was because people coming from Japan were not given the right of citizenship, which meant they were unable to purchase land. She explained that it ended up being easier for them to lease land from the Yakama Nation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"That is why many of them lived on the reservation,\" Kondo told the students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the students in Wells's class, Lauren Antonio, said after hearing Kondo talk about the isolation of the Japanese in America and after reading the book \"Farewell to Manzinea,\" several class members got together to talk about whether or not the students had ever felt isolated from society because they were different.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antonio said during the discussion it became apparent that many of his classmates felt that at some point in their lives they had been bothered because they were different. He said there were a wide range of things that came up during the discussion.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Antonio said one thing the entire group agreed on after the discussion, is that although they may have felt singled out or different at some point in their lives, it was nothing like what happened to the Japanese living in the United States more than 60 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kondo told the students that she can still remember the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. She said on Dec. 7, 1941, she remembers going to church but not hearing the radio announcement that the Navy base had been bombed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My father looked very, very troubled when we got home,\" Kondo told the students. \"That was when we realized that Pearl Harbor was bombed.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

        "text":"Earlier report of cuts to Alderwood Police Department much rosier now\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 11/17/2004\r\n\r\nPrior to Tuesday night's Alderwood City Council budget study session, life at the Alderwood Police Department looked pretty grim for 2005.\r\n\r\nCity Manager Tom Rockford released a memo at the beginning of November that detailed where proposed budget cuts would be made in 2005 to help offset a $393,910 revenue shortfall.\r\n\r\nOne of the areas that was proposed in the 2005 budget to help save money was not filling four positions at the police department, three of which were vacant at the time.\r\n\r\nBut thanks to voters in Alderwood County passing a 3/10's of 1 percent sales tax with the money to go towards law and justice county-wide, the Alderwood Police Department has found new life.\r\n\r\nAlderwood Police Chief Ted Mana Tuesday night outlined his plans for utilizing the money from the county sales tax in the coming year.\r\n\r\nIn all, the Alderwood Police Department has four vacancies-one vacancy in the corrections department, one from the death of Sgt. Steve Evans and the other two from two patrol officers leaving for other positions.\r\n\r\n\"No one currently employed is going to be losing their jobs,\" said Mana.\r\n\r\nMana told Council he wants to use the county tax money to hire an officer at the beginning of the year. This will allow the department to retain the traffic officer position, which is currently being held by Kent Coffman. Without hiring an additonal officer at the beginning of the year, Coffman's services would have had to be used elsewhere in the department to cover vacancies.\r\n\r\n\"We believe that is an important enough function,\" said Mana.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the year, Mana plans to hire another officer in hopes of providing the detectives division with some additional assistance. Also at mid-year, Mana plans to create an administrative secretary position, replacing a data entry person that will be leaving.\r\n\r\nThe proposed law enforcement budget for 2005 is $2.1 million.\r\n\r\nThe major expenditure in this department is salaries, $1.2 million.\r\n\r\nRockford told Council Tuesday night about a plan he has to lease police vehicles in 2005. As a result, Council was able to take $35,000 from the $163,760 set aside in the line item for other services and charges. The $35,000 will now go to help operate the Alderwood Community Center, said Rockford.\r\n\r\nOne significant expenditure in the law enforcement budget deals with overtime. For 2005, Mana has set aside $92,000 for overtime, which is up considerably from $56,420 in 2004. The 2004 amount was based in part on a strong desire by Council to reduce the overtime budget. In 2003, the police department had an overtime budget of $103,395. Mana said his overtime budget is based on past usage. The most difficult problem with overtime in the police department, said Mana, is having to fill positions when staff members are gone. Mana said the amount being set aside for overtime is still less than it would cost to hire people for the actual positions.\r\n\r\nOf the 34 current staff members at the police department, Mana said 22 of those are commissioned officers. The police department is currently at staffing levels for officers that it had in 1991, the chief told Council.\r\n\r\nCouncilman Tom Seeger said he was worried about how overtime would be affected once the new dispatch center at the law and justice center is completed by the middle of next year. Mana said overtime will be a concern at the new center.\r\n\r\nHowever, the city will be having some new revenue from housing prisoners that will assist in paying for overtime expenses, said Mana. The United States Marshal Service is closing some of its locations around the state and will now be using the Alderwood jail to house prisoners.\r\n\r\nSeeger was also concerned with the city's involvement with the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), a program operated by the Washington State Patrol. . The police department currently dedicates one office to working with HIDTA. Mana said there is benefits to the partnership, such as having an officer working with HIDTA on a full-time basis. Seeger wanted to see what kind of cost benefits there is to the city to continue this partnership.\r\n\r\nSeeger was also curious about the partnership the city has with the school district for funding the two school resource officers. Mana said the school district has increased its funding for the positions to $100,000 annually. The city pays about one-third of the costs to have the officers in the schools. The police department gets the services of the two officers back during the summer months. Mana said an issue is that during the summer months, the officers usually take their vacation, so there is no real benefit to the city.\r\n\r\nThe budget for the corrections department is a separate item. The proposed 2005 corrections department budget is $537,410, which is an increase from the $516,010 budgeted in 2004. The increase in the budget comes under the line item for supplies, which increases from $97,300 in 2004 to $157,500 in 2005. Captain Bill Bank said the primary expenses in supplies are the meals for prisoners and cleaning supplies. Bank said the corrections budget is a conservative estimate of where it should be.\r\n\r\nThe proposed communications department budget at the police department is $492,190 for 2005. This budget covers the dispatching services.\r\n"

Bones was unable to be at Thursday night's school board meeting because of a personal commitment. Bones said until he can get some more clarification on what happened with the bid process for the vehicles, he is putting the issue on hold.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(The) bid (is) on hold until we can review it with legal counsel and the state auditor,\" said Bones Friday morning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The issue concerns the district purchasing two vehicles for the MSRS program, which would in turn lease the cars from the school district. Alderwood School District is the fiscal agent for the MSRS program. MSRS program workers travel all over the state to aid migrant students. MSRS Director Lee Campos wants to purchase the vehicles because it will be less expensive than paying his staff a mileage stipend.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The school district received three bids for the vehicles, one from Toyota of Yakima, another from Tom Denchel Ford and a third from the state vehicle bid process through Harris Ford of Lynnwood.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bid from Toyota of Yakima for each vehicle was $20,195. Denchel's had a significantly less bid of $14,212 per car while the state bid from Harris Ford was $13,429.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The school board went with the recommendation of Executive Director of Finance Dave Plesha to purchase two, 2004 Camrys from Toyota of Yakima.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bones said Friday morning he will be reviewing the entire bid process for the vehicles again before any final decision is made.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

Alderwood will attempt to nab its first conference win this Thursday night against visiting Prosser. The Lady Grizzlies will play their third consecutive home league match this coming Saturday afternoon against Hanford.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the exception of the middle game of the three-set match last night, Alderwood gave the visiting 'Dogs all they could handle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn the opener, Alderwood forged an 8-4 lead. The Lady Grizzlies' jumped out to the early advantage, thanks mostly to the back-to-back kills slammed by junior Christy Linde and a service ace ripped by senior Erica Mendez. Ellensburg rallied, though, and down the stretch the two clubs stayed within a point or two of each other. In the end, it was the Bulldogs pulling away for a 25-21 decision. Linde had four of her five kills last night in the opening game.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unable to get any kind of a run going when serving the ball, Alderwood was quickly dispatched in the second contest, coming up on the short end of a 25-10 score.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We got all of our points on sideouts,\" lamented Alderwood Coach Angel Carrizales. \"We never once served a run.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fischer was a dynamo for the 'Dogs in the second game, coming through with nine consecutive service points.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A lot of that had to do with our serve-receive errors,\" Carrizales said. She explained that her Lady Grizzlies will be working on returning serves in upcoming practices.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ellensburg swung out to an 8-4 lead in the third set, \"...but we hung in there,\" said Carrizales. The Lady Grizzlies eventually knotted the score at 14-all. During that game tying rally, Linde collected five straight service points, which included notching one ace from the service line. After Ellensburg rallied to forge a 19-18 lead, the Bulldogs closed out the action with six consecutive service points from Fischer to end the game at 25-18.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDespite sustaining the loss last night, Carrizales said there were positives that came out of the match. \"One of our goals was to keep our service errors to just six. We only missed four serves, so that was a very good thing,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lady Grizzlies' top server was Linde. A jump-server, she blasted all 13 of her attempts successfully over the net.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, though, Alderwood's girls showed they need to improve on their serve-receive efforts.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Individually for Alderwood, Mendez and Talia Spini turned in the best performances at the net against Ellensburg. They each had five kills and two blocks. The team's primary setter, Kacee Jo Bootsma, was credited with 14 assists, and Alderwood teammate Devina Martinez collected 24 digs.\r\n"

        "text":"Lower Valley legislators begin work anew today\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 1/12/2004\r\n\r\nOLYMPIA - For the next two months, Lower Valley legislators Dan Newhouse and Bruce Chandler are going to have their hands full. The two Republican state representatives joined their cohorts in Olympia today for the 2004 session.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis year's gathering in Olympia for the state's elected officials will be a short 60-day session. Both men say much work must be crammed into the short period of time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides trying to thwart the attempts of Gov. Gary Locke to siphon money from the state's reserve funds, Newhouse and Chandler say legislators' plates will be filled this year with several issues that need to be addressed immediately.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of those issues is reforming the state's medical malpractice guidelines. Both Alderwood area legislators say the current costs of malpractice insurance, in terms of both premiums and settlements, are bankrupting the medical profession and driving physicians out of the state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's at a point of total meltdown,\" said Newhouse, presently serving his first term in the House of Representatives.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We're losing doctors, especially in our smaller communities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Right now there are 21 doctors in Yakima County who can't get malpractice insurance. It's either too expensive or it's not offered,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Newhouse and Chandler explain that one of the reasons the premiums for medical malpractice insurance are not affordable is because claims are so high. The two political allies say caps must be implemented on all medical malpractice claims.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"One of the ideas being talked about is assigning an amount of responsibility,\" said Chandler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In essence, that means setting a percentage or a ceiling on the amount of money a claimant could collect. Newhouse and Chandler are quick to point out that advocates of this idea aren't trying to limit the insurance payout to people who successfully file claims for such things as actual medical bills and time lost from work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What we're talking about is a pain and suffering cap,\" said Newhouse, explaining that instead of millions of dollars being awarded by courtroom juries, a more sensible ceiling for such settlements might fall in the $250,000 range.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Newhouse is a sitting member of the House judiciary committee, which ensures that at the very least the topic of medical malpractice reform will be addressed this session.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAlso apt to be tossed around in legislative chambers this session, say Newhouse and Chandler, is the issue of health care costs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We've had double-digit growth in health care costs for several years,\" said Chandler. \"Health care costs are affecting everyone...business, you and me, state government.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Changes that are needed, say the two legislators, include Medicaid reimbursement rate adjustments, redefining small group insurance rates and having more flexibility in insurance coverages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reforming the way the state adjudicates water rights is bound to come up in discussions in Olympia this session, too. The two men said the state's \"use it or lose it\" measure needs to be changed so that farmers and ranchers aren't penalized for not using irrigation water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"After all, if you don't need irrigation water one season and you leave water in the stream, it's benefiting fish,\" said Chandler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under current state law, those holding water rights must give up their water to the state if they haven't utilized their rights for five successive years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reform to the state's Department of Labor and Industries division is also badly needed, say both Chandler and Newhouse.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We need to look at how the L&I trust fund is managed,\" said Chandler. \"And, L&I has to do a better job at getting people back to work.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Accountability is needed-both in minimizing fraud and in doing a better job of getting people's claims approved in a more timely manner,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Newhouse and Chandler said they are also unhappy with the news that Locke, who is giving up his seat as governor this fall, has indicated that his supplemental budget will draw down the surplus funds that have been stored away by legislators.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Locke is abandoning the (budgetary) principles that were established last year,\" said Newhouse.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He and Chandler went on to explain that Locke is proposing to expand on the state's existing programs, in areas such as increasing the enrollment counts at state universities.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If we deplete our reserves and abandon our budget approach, it will make for more difficult times,\" said Chandler. \"What's being proposed in this supplemental budget will amount to a $1 billion deficit.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both men say now is not the time to put Washington state into further economic peril. They said the sound financial principles that were adhered to in last year's legislative session need to be continued this session, in hopes that the state's economic climate continues to rebound.\u00a0\u00a0"

        "text":"FDA starts investigation of Boynton\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 4/16/2004\r\n\r\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it was beginning an investigation of Alderwood's Boynton Laboratories, a pioneering prion research lab yesterday, the timing seemed a bit off.\r\n\r\nBritish researchers had just identified a second case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) transmitted through a blood transfusion. The UK Medical Research Council is set to launch a trial of potential vCJD treatments, but there are no such trials in the US. A report released last winter by the National Academy of Sciences says the US research program on prion diseases is \"small, aging, and inadequately funded, except with a possible shining star in new Boynton Laboratories...\"\r\n\r\nThe FDA quickly responded that the lab's investigation is meant to address scientific concerns, not exacerbate political ones. Boynton Laboratories, founded in 2002, is focused on finding cures for prion diseases, says Laurel Sulfate, spokeswoman for the institution. Alderwood Mayor Rex Luthor called the investigation \"outrageous\" and called for the FDA to become \"a partner in progress, not a bureaucratic impediment to the nation's health and well-being.\"\r\n"

        "text":"Council ponders ways to fund ambulance service\r\nStory by: John Panni\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/24/2004\r\n\r\nThe discussion at Monday night's Alderwood City Council meeting concerning the city implementing an ambulance utility fee went many different directions. But by the time everything was said and done, the Council reached a consensus of sorts that the public will eventually decide what kind of ambulance/fire department service it wants.\r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, Alderwood residents have been paying a $3 per month fee to help fund the city's ambulance service. Residents were billed the fee along with their water and sewer service, said Alderwood City Manager Tom Rockford. The fee generated $140,000 per year. The city has been supplementing the service to the tune of $600,000, said Rockford.\r\n\r\nThe problem for the city in collecting the fee came this past May when the Washington Supreme Court ruled an ambulance service fee the City of Kennewick was collecting was illegal. Rockford said since Alderwood adopted the same fee structure Kennewick did it meant the city's fee was also illegal. This past June, Alderwood officials suspended collecting the ambulance utility fee from residents.\r\n\r\nRockford presented Council Monday night with an ambulance fee the city could implement that he believes could pass the legal requirements of the courts.\r\n\r\nRockford said the major difference between the fee he is proposing and the former one is it is not only assessed to residents, but businesses, as well.\r\n\r\n\"It is set up as a utility fee,\" said Rockford. \"It has some of the characteristics of our water and sewer utility.\"\r\n\r\nThe fee would assess a $3 per month charge to all households on the basis 3.6 residents are living at each home. Businesses would then be charged $3 per month for every 3.6 employees they have up to a maximum of 101 employees.\r\n\r\nRockford explained residents in the city limits of Alderwood would be charged a city rate for services provided while residents out of city limits would be charged a higher fee to utilize the local ambulance service. Out-of-town residents will roughly see a $300 increase in prices for city ambulance service.\r\n\r\nRockford added that with the addition of the businesses having to absorb the monthly fee, the city will raise an additional $72,000 for the ambulance service.\r\n\r\nAnother part to the discussion centered around raising the Medicaid/Medicare rates to where the city is being reimbursed appropriately. The city currently charges Medicaid/Medicare extensively lower reimbursement rates than it should, said Rockford. Rockford was proposing across the board increases for everything from mileage to medical care, estimating the city would receive $40,000 in additional funding from Medicaid/Medicare.\r\n\r\nRockford said Alderwood must have some sort of ambulance service to offer its residents.\r\n\r\n\"To some extent a fire department is an insurance policy,\" said Rockford.\r\n\r\nHe said in going out into the community he has heard continuously from residents how much they like the ambulance service the city offers now. Rockford said the key for the Council is to agree on a structure for the ambulance service that the city can depend on for revenue.\r\n\r\n\"The ordinance we feel will pass the mustard in court,\" said Rockford.\r\n\r\nRockford said he wants to continue discussion in September with the Council on the proposed ambulance fee. He also wants to hold an open house to invite local business owners to offer input on how the fee would affect them.\r\n\r\nCouncil agreed unanimously to change the Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates to the higher amounts. A public hearing with expected adoption is set to take place at the Monday, Sept. 13, Council meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Council couldn't quite agree so whole-heartedly about the ambulance service fees.\r\n\r\nCouncilman John Torch was concerned about shifting costs to businesses. Torch wanted to open up discussion with other cities about how they handle ambulance services before agreeing to any set fee.\r\n\r\nCouncilman Tom Seeger, who has been adamant about how the ambulance service is a drain on the current expense fund, expressed his opinion on the matter. Seeger said only 5 percent of cities statewide provide an ambulance service with their fire department.\r\n\r\n\"There is a reason,\" said Seeger. \"They are black holes that suck money. It is nice to have a Cadillac service, but we are paying a Ferrari price tag.\"\r\n\r\nSeeger wanted to do a comparison with Grandview on why that city can maintain a fire insurance rating of five while only having two paid firemen.\r\n\r\nSeeger wants to leave the choice to local residents on whether they fund the ambulance service or not. Seeger suggested putting the measure before voters during a special February ballot issue. But, Seeger wanted to remind residents that if they vote to keep the present ambulance service with the monthly fees that have been suggested then they are going to have to pay for the construction of a new fire station down the road. Seeger said with privatizing the ambulance service residents would not have to pay for a new fire station. Seeger said he didn't believe the fee that was being proposed to fund the ambulance service would be enough. Seeger said the city would need to charge residents and businesses $5 to $6 per month to see any economic benefit.\r\n\r\nCouncil members brought into the discussion regionalization of the ambulance service and how a business fee for the service might deter economic growth in the community.\r\n\r\n\"The only way it is going to pass the mustard of the court is (if we) charge residents and businesses,\" said Rockford. \"By applying it city-wide we pass the mustard of the court.\"\r\n\r\n.

        "text":"Alderwood School Board Briefs\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/30/2004\r\n\r\nDistrict passes transportation inspection\r\nLast Thursday night, Alderwood School District Transportation Supervisor David Taylor talked to the school board about the recent transportation inspection. He explained that the district's fleet of vehicles in inspected by the Washington State Patrol twice a year. He said there is one surprise inspection in the winter and a more thorough inspection done just before school starts.\r\nTaylor said during the most recent inspection 38 buses were looked at and only a couple of issues came up. Taylor said there were seven lights out among the buses, but considering that each bus has 42 to 50 lights the ratio isn't too bad.\r\nTaylor said two buses were pulled out of service, one was a mini bus and another was a bus the district plans on using for parts.\r\n\"Both of those buses were from the early '80s,\" Taylor said.\r\nOverall, Taylor said the district fared well in the inspection.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBoard works to set up sex education committee\r\nThursday night, Alderwood School Board members came together to find a way to appoint a Health, Family Life and Sex Education Ad Hoc Committee. The formation of the committee comes after parents voiced concerns about the sex education curriculum taught in the district.\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Aaron Bones explained that more than 20 people had shown interest in serving on the committee, meaning the only task left was deciding how many members the committee would be made up of and who would serve on it.\r\nSchool board member Bill Wells suggested the board be made up of three community members, one student, one teacher, one administrator and a chairman.\r\nBones expressed concern that one teacher wouldn't be able to represent the concerns of all teachers in the district when it comes to the subject of sex education.\r\nUltimately, the board decided the committee would be comprised of three parents, two teachers, one student and one administrator, with the group coming together to select a chair.\r\n\u00a0\r\nBoard approves discipline handbooks\r\nAlderwood School Board members voted Thursday night to approve the discipline handbooks for the 2004-05 school year.\r\nAdministrators from each of the schools in the district presented the board with a copy of their handbook, which was presented to students at the beginning of the school year.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSEA contract changes approved\r\nChanges to Alderwood Education Association (SEA) contracts were approved by the Alderwood School Board last Thursday night.\r\nSuperintendent Dr. Aaron Bones pointed out that some of the changes included in the contract were provisions for elementary planning time and changes in leave language. For example, he noted that maternity and adoption leaves are now both called family leave.\r\nOverall, board chair Joanne Kilian said the bargaining process went well this year.\r\n\"It was a very good process,\" Kilian said.\r\nAccording to the board, the SEA ratified the contract changes Tuesday.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFirst day of school draws 4,684 youths\r\nThursday night, Executive Director of Business Dave Plesha talked to members of the Alderwood School Board about enrollment numbers.\r\nPlesha said the first day of school, Aug. 25, there were 4,684 students in the district, which does not include kindergarten students, who didn't start classes until Aug. 27.\r\nPlesha told board members that the number of students registered in the district increased by 265 students on Thursday, Aug. 26.\r\nHe noted that the official count is set to take place Tuesday, Sept. 7.\r\n\u00a0\r\nEarly Learning Center has 20 students attending\r\nExecutive Director of School and Community Resources Ruben Carrera told members of the Alderwood School Board Thursday night there are currently 20 students enrolled in the district's Early Learning Center.\r\nHe added that the number of infants enrolled in the center is at capacity and there is already a waiting list for those wanting to attend classes at the facility.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWASL scores release date announced\r\nThursday night, Executive Director of Instruction and Learning Gary Vegar, announced that the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction is set to release Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL) scores Wednesday, Sept. 1, at 10 a.m.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFirst day of school runs smoothly district wide\r\nAdministrators representing schools from throughout the Alderwood School District reported to members of the school board that the first day of school ran smoothly this year.\r\n\"It went really well,\" said Harrison Middle School Principal Janie Hernandez.\r\nDennis Birr of Alderwood High School said despite a few glitches, everything went fairly well the first day.\r\n\"The teachers were great,\" Birr said. \"Everyone was upbeat.\"\r\n\u00a0"

        "text":"U.S. Senate candidate visits Alderwood, a big believer in regulatory reform\r\nStory by: Ellie Olmsen\r\nDate Published to Web: 8/13/2004\r\n\r\nWho is Reed Davis? He will tell you, straight away, that he is the conservative in the race for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Democrat Patty Murray.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This morning (Friday), Davis stopped by the Alderwood Republican Club meeting to talk about his campaign and what he hopes to accomplish if he is elected to the U.S. Senate.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis said one of his first priorities is regulatory reform, noting that it is something that affects everyone from small business owners to farmers.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"One thing that drives business to its knees...is federal regulation,\" Davis said. He added that on average every business in the state spends $7,000 per employee, per year just to stay in compliance with federal regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis said he has talked to farmers and business owners throughout the state in regards to their concerns about federal regulations. He said one farmer in particular stood out in his mind, a Kittitas County farmer who told him a that it isn't the fact that a government agency, like the Environmental Protection Agency, comes out to his farm and tells him what is wrong that bothers him. \r\n\r\nInstead, Davis told members of the local Republic club, what bothered this farmer was the next step in the process.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis said the government agency then steps in and tries to tell that farmer just how he is going to bring his farm into compliance, regardless of the cost or the effectiveness of the method.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis said that farmer told him that he feels he should be allowed, with his own ingenuity, to figure out how to come into compliance without a government agency giving him step-by-step instructions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis said this is where relief from federal regulations would come in. He explained that it would give farmers and other business owners a chance to work with government agencies to fix any problems that might come up, instead of being forced to work under them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We do not create a climate of trust,\" Davis said about the current system. \"We need regulatory relief so [businesses and farmers are] no longer the bad guy,\" he added.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis then took time to talk about the federal deficit.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"We have to begin to reign in federal spending,\" Davis said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He said the way the federal government is currently spending will ultimately cripple the next generation of Americans. Davis said it is his belief that things like social security can still be saved, noting that people should be given a chance to take a chunk of their money and put it into personal accounts, allowing them to save for the future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to a constitutional amendment that would ban same-sex marriage, Davis told members of the local Republican club that it is something he supports.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Children need to be loved by both a mother and a father,\" Davis said. He then pointed to research that suggests children need to have a family that consists of a mother and a father.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis said the current situation, where courts across the country are making the decision of whether or not same-sex marriage is legal, is not the proper way to go about things. He said he feels that anything less than a constitutional amendment in regards to same-sex marriage, \"...will be nothing more than a stop gap.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nDavis also took time to talk about his support of the Black Rock Reservoir project.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In this state the farming community really wants one thing - water,\" Davis said. \"I think the most important thing you need is water.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis is running against Rep. George Nethercutt for the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Murray.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davis, who lives in Maple Valley, is an associate professor at Seattle Pacific University, where he teaches classes on political science. He has also served as the chair of the King County Republican Party for eight years.\r\n"

        "text":"'Hounds open CWAC play with 35-14 victory\r\nStory by: Bob Story\r\nDate Published to Web: 9/13/2004\r\n\r\nBENTON CITY - In its season opener two Fridays ago, the Grandview High School football team committed more mistakes than it could overcome in a 32-25 loss to class 3A Alderwood. This past Friday night, the class 2A Greyhounds played nearly error-free. The end result was a 35-14 victory over the hapless Ki-Be Bears.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We cut our mistakes down from the Alderwood game,\" said Grandview first year coach Dustin Lamb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The new Greyhound coach said his players also took advantage of what Ki-Be gave them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ki-Be loaded the box to take away the run from us,\" Lamb said. \"So we went to the air, and it worked.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll told, a total of six receivers caught at least one pass against the Bears. Quarterback Brandon Artz's favorite targets, though, were Kevin Concienne and James Vela. The duo combined for three touchdowns. Vela gained 153 yards on four receptions, and Concienne picked up 73 yards on his five catches. Ryan Dill also hauled in a TD pass from Artz, a 36-yarder that got Grandview on the scoreboard first.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Artz finished the night connecting on 11-of-17 passes, which netted 274 aerial yards for the 'Hounds. His four touchdown throws easily offset the one interception the Bears had against him.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Grandview (1-0, 1-1) did go to the ground, it was senior Silas Hansen who took the majority of the hand-offs from Artz. Hansen put the punctuation mark on the game for the 'Hounds with his 3-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter. His short scamper gave Grandview a 35-0 lead. Hansen finished with 50 hard fought yards, coming on 14 totes. Teammate J.R. Camacho added six rushing yards on four carries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ki-Be, which was limited to 192 yards of offense, scored two fourth quarter touchdowns after Lamb began subbing freely from his bench.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The win over the Bears came in Grandview's Central Washington Athletic Conference league opener. Grandview, which was dropped from the 3A ranks to class 2A this year, is making its debut in the CWAC this season, after having played in the Mid-Valley League for several years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if Grandview fans think the 'Hounds are going to have a cakewalk through the class 2A CWAC this season, they might want to think again. Grandview hosts the perennially tough Connell Eagles this coming Friday night, and Lamb says his club has its work cut out for it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\"Connell is huge, and very physical,\" Lamb said. \"They nearly knocked off East Valley last Friday, and East Valley is the top rated 2A team in the state.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To beat Connell the Greyhounds are going to have to win the war in the trenches, said Lamb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Our line is going to have to play big against Connell,\" he said. \"The game will either be won up front or lost up front.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lamb is hoping his linemen turn in as strong of an effort against the Eagles this coming Friday as they did against Ki-Be this past weekend. \"Our line did a super job of protecting Brandon (Artz) last Friday,\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defensive line of the 'Hounds also excelled against Ki-Be, especially defensive end Cody McMillen. Outside linebacker Chris Mejia turned in a strong effort, as well, for Grandview against the Bears. The Greyhounds' defensive secondary might have played even stronger against Ki-Be, as they limited the Bears to just 49 passing yards. Vela, playing cornerback, had an interception for the 'Hounds, and Matt Emerson from the other cornerback slot also shined with excellent defensive run support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n"

The amount the Humane Society asked Council to approve, which it did, in 2004 was $1,815 per month, or $21,786 per year.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2003, the Humane Society shelter housed more than 11,000 animals, 504 of which came from within the Alderwood city limits. Dogs accounted for the largest number of animals housed at the Humane Society. In 2003, the Humane Society catered to 290 dogs from the Alderwood area, 132 of which were euthenized. Alderwood area cats were also a frequent visitor to the Humane Shelter. There were 178 cats from the Alderwood area taken to the Yakima shelter in 2003, 125 of which were euthenized.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of the 504 Alderwood area animals taken to the Humane Society shelter, 259 of them were killed. The shelter did manage to find homes for 108 of the animals, 98 of which were dogs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the terms of the agreement, the Humane Society agrees to provide at least 20 hours of service within the Alderwood city limits. The Humane Society also agrees to pick up all injured or dead animals as part of the contract.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The city will be pay $6 per day for any dogs housed at the Humane Society that are needed in criminal investigation cases.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the event of extra patrol needed, the city will pay the Humane Society $25 per hour.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The contract also states the city will keep all of the money from fines.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n"

The kick-off event will be held at the Lower Valley Law and Justice Center from 5 to 8 p.m.\r\nLuthor encouraged the Council members to be on hand for the community barbecue and evening of entertainment, information fair and games, all planned as part of the evening, under the direction of Chico Rodriguez and his NNO committee.\r\n"
